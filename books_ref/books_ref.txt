What impact does minimum wage legislation have on wages and employment opportunities in an
informal sector in a developing country? The paper answers this question in the context of minimumwage legislation for domestic workers in India over the period of 2004–2012. Combining, matching
procedure with difference-in-difference estimation approach, supported by extensive robustness
checks, the paper estimates both the short-run and the long-run impact of the legislation on real wagesand employment. Results show a positive impact of the legislation on real wages in the shortrun, whilethere is limited evidence of this effect persisting in the long-run. Further, the legislation did not seem
to have any impact at the extensive margin on the probability of being employed as a domestic worker
over short or long run. Our analysis further reveals that the wages of majority of workers remain belowthe minimum wage. Available evidence from the ground, in line with theoretical predictions, point
towards weak enforcement of the legislation as the potential driving factor of observed results. As
India recently extended national level minimum wage for all workers, the paper provides a cautionarytale on the potential pitfalls of implementation of this legislation in informal sector and suggests some
ways to overcome the same.

1. Introduction
The impact of minimum wage legislations on employment and
wages has been the subject of extensive empirical work.1While the
majority of existing studies focus on the impact of minimum wage
laws in developed countries, there is an emerging focus ondeveloping countries exploring similar empirical questions. Most of
these studies show mixed evidence on the impact of minimum wage
laws. The ﬁndings suggest that while minimum wage laws tend to
increase wages at the intensive margin, the impact on employment
at the extensive margin is unclear with results showing positive,
neutral or a negative impact.
However, the empirical literature on the the impact of mini-
mum wages for informal sector sector, which contributes to more
than 60% of the global employment ( ILO, 2018 ), is still an emerging
area of research. One of the most understudied groups within
informal sector is that of domestic workers comprising of employ-
ees in private households working as maid servants, cook, watch
man and other jobs.2The paper asks, what impact does minimum
wage legislation have on an informal sector such as domestic work?
Does it improve the earnings and employment opportunities of
workers? The paper studies the short and long run impact of theminimum wage legislation on wages and employment opportunities
for domestic workers in India. The paper relies on four rounds of a
cross-sectional national sample survey (NSS 1999, 2004, 2009 and

2012 rounds). This study exploits state level heterogeneity in mini-
mum wage legislation across states in India over 2004 and 2012.3
To overcome the limitation of lack of panel data, our identiﬁcationstrategy combines matching with difference in difference estima-
tions. The matching of domestic workers within treatment states
with their counter parts in control states, both before and after treat-
ment period, on a set of observable characteristics help us to create
suitable counterfactual. The paper then analyzes the impact of the
minimum wage laws on both the intensive (wages) and extensive
margins (employment opportunity).
India makes an interesting case due to several reasons. Firstly,
according to National Domestic Worker’s Movement in India, the
number of domestic workers in India range from 4.2 million to 50
million, implying this is a relatively large sector within India.4Sec-
ondly, domestic household workers were one of informal sector occu-pational groups not covered by the national minimum wage law in
India until very recently (August 2019). One of the primary reasons
for the non inclusion of the domestic services sector in India under
the National Minimum Wage act of 1948 has been the fact that it is
a very personalized (informal) service within a private household.
After renewed struggle by domestic workers, a few states in India
brought domestic services under coverage of minimum wage laws
over the past decade. Pressure has been mounting from civil society
organisations and domestic worker unions on other States to do the
same. However, with the passage of the Code on Wages Bill in August
2019, all informal sector workers including domestic workers have
come under a minimum a wage law for the ﬁrst time. Hence, compil-
ing lessons from the states that pioneered implementation of mini-
mum wages for informal sector like domestic worker is very timely,
as it can provide insights on the issues that India might confront on
the implementation of the new Code on Wages Bill.
The existing empirical literature on the impact of minimum
wage legislation for domestic workers in India are mostly qualita-
tive (see Section 3). This literature primarily focuses on how the
minimum wages were notiﬁed and implemented in each of the four
states in India. The case-analysis at the micro level suggest that the
minimum wage laws for domestic workers were found wanting in
their construction, implementation and effectiveness vis- /C18a-vis
other work sectors ( Neetha, 2009; Neetha, 2013; Neetha, 2013a;
Eluri & Singh, 2013 ). Hence there is a need to quantify the impact
of the minimum wage laws for domestic workers in India. Studying
impact of any legislation on the informal sector is challenging. Most
importantly, there are limited number of surveys that systemati-
cally account for informal sector workers. Further, the informal nat-
ure of the sector implies that very often there are no written
contracts or formal records of transactions that can be exploited
for analytical work. In this paper, we overcome some of these lim-
itations by identifying precise informal sector workers, employed in
domestic work in India from the national sample surveys and col-
lect information pertaining to individual employment and wages
directly or from their household heads. By following the cohort of
domestic workers over repeated cross-sectional surveys we try to
delineate the impact of minimum wages legislation.
Based on the data reported by domestic workers, the paper
ﬁnds a strong positive impact of the legislation on real wages in
the short-run between, 2004 and 2009, while we do not ﬁnd evi-
dence of signiﬁcant positive impact on wages in the long run by
2012. There seems to be no impact of the legislation at the exten-
sive margin on the probability of being employed as a domestic
sector worker in both the short and the long-run. However in the
short run, the magnitude of impact on real wages seems to be largeindicating a 30 percent increase in mean real wages compared to
control states. The results are consistent for different speciﬁcations
and for a number of robustness and sensitivity checks (see Sections
7). In explaining the mechanism that drives the results, we conduct
a variety of tests to distinguish between supply-side effects from
worker mobility and enforcement. With the available evidence,
we lean towards weak monitoring and enforcement mechanism
of the law as the key factor driving the observed results in terms
of wages and employment.
Our results are in line with the existing, albeit limited, literature
from India evaluating impact of minimum wages ( Menon & Van
Der Meulen Rodgers, 2017; Menon & Van Der Meulen Rodgers,
2018; Soundararajan, 2019 ).Menon and Van Der Meulen Rodgers
(2017) explores gender disaggregated impact of minimum wages
in rural and urban areas. Menon and Van Der Meulen Rodgers
(2018) studies the impact of minimum wages on child labour.
Soundararajan (2019) analyse the interaction between minimum
wages and enforcement in the case of construction sector workers.
The general conclusion from these studies is that minimum wage
laws have an impact on wages, especially at or above the median
of the wage distribution. In terms of employment, minimum wages
seems to have had no impact in urban areas, with some positive
effect on paid labour in rural sector. With the focus on urban areas,
our results are in line with the existing ﬁndings of these studies.
However, we ﬁnd that the positive impact of minimum-wages on
wages disappears in the long-run. Hence, the beneﬁts of expanding
minimum wage coverage to all casual workers (like domestic
workers) may not necessarily deliver the kind of beneﬁts in terms
of reduced wage inequality, poverty and the gender pay gap as
simulated by Belser and Rani (2011) for India.
The results of the paper are also in line with theoretical models
presented in Basu, Chau, and Kanbur (2010) which highlights the
need to look at the interaction of imperfect competition, enforce-
ment and commitment from Government on the impact of mini-
mum wages on labour market outcomes. Hence, the key policy
message of our paper is that highly vulnerable informal sector
workers need a lot more than just an ‘announcement effect’ of min-
imum wage legislation in order to make a real positive impact on
their livelihoods (see Section 6).
The paper contributes to the literature in the following manner.
First, the study attempts to quantify the effect of minimum wage
laws for domestic workers on both real wages and employment,
and contributes to the emerging literature studying the labour
effects of minimum wages in informal sector settings both in short
and long run. Second, the study adds to the limited literature
studying the impact of minimum wages on the informal sector in
India. While 86 % of employment take place in the informal sector,
there is very limited research on the impact of minimum wages inIndia ( Broecke et al., 2017 ). Third, it provides validation of existing
theoretical literature on the impact of minimum wages in informal
sectors, with a focus on enforcement.
The rest of the paper is divided into following sections. Section 2
provides a brief overview of existing literature on impact evalua-
tion of minimum wages, with a focus on informal sector workers.
Section 2.2will give the theoretical motivation informing our anal-
ysis. Section 3will discuss the domestic work sector in India and
describe the implementation of minimum wages. Section 4will
describe the data and empirical methodology used in the paper.
Section 5will provide our main results. It starts with exploring
the impact of the legislation on wages, followed by discussion of
impact of the legislation on employment. Section 6discusses
potential mechanisms that could drive the observed results. Sec-
tion 7describes extensive robustness checks and sensitivity analy-
sis for the key results. Some of the key robustness checks
conducted involve verifying parallel trends assumption, common
support, state-time trends, checking effects in a placebo sector,3In India four states introduced minimum wages for domestic workers over 2004
and 2009. Karnataka was the ﬁrst to institute minimum wages for domestic workersin 2004, followed by Bihar and Andhra Pradesh in 2007 and Rajasthan in 2008.

2. Literature
2.1. Empirical Literature
The empirical literature on the the impact of minimum wages
for informal sector in developing countries while still relatively
small, is an emerging area of empirical research. Most of these
studies focus on Latin American countries using ﬁrm or sectoral
level data ( Bell, 1997; Carneiro, 2001; Maloney & Mendez,
2013; Maloney, 2004; Lemos et al., 2004; Almeida & Carneiro,
2005; Neumark et al., 2006; Almeida & Carneiro, 2007; Gindling
& Terrell, 2007; Ronconi, 2008; Lemos, 2009; Gindling & Terrell,
2009; Almeida & Carneiro, 2011; Khamis, 2013; Broecke et al.,
2017; Menon & Van Der Meulen Rodgers, 2017; Menon & Van
Der Meulen Rodgers, 2018; Soundararajan, 2019 ). The main ﬁnd-
ings are the following. First, minimum wage legislation com-
pressed the wage distribution for both the informal and formal
labor market and contributed to positive impact on wages. Sec-
ond, minimum wage seem to have had a mixed effect on employ-
ment outcomes. Some studies point to negative employment
effects of varying degree, while others ﬁnd positive employment
effect in informal sectors and a negative employment effect in for-
mal sectors. While some studies have pointed to null or negligible
employment effects across both informal and formal labor
markets.5
The variation in these effects seem to be related to the level of
minimum wages and the degree of informality. In low minimum
wage settings with high degree of informality the null or negligible
employment effects seem to persists across different countries
(Broecke et al., 2017 ). When it comes to vulnerability of workers
most of the existing studies deﬁne it as those who have relatively
low skills or education, or those who are relatively young or those
who are women ( Maloney, 2004 ).
Therefore in order to evaluate the impact of minimum wage
legislation for vulnerable groups in developing countries it is
important to focus on speciﬁc sectors that can uncover the source
of informality. One such sector is the domestic work sector, where
there is little possibility of market driven social protection for
workers unless the state directly intervenes through legislation.
Further this sector in many developing countries are dominated
by vulnerable groups such as young or female workers who have
little bargaining power ( D’souza, 2010 ). This sector is especially
under-studied within the broad empirical literature on minimum
wages. There are only a handful of studies conﬁned to few geo-
graphical areas such as the USA and South Africa ( Mattila, 1973;
Dinkelman & Ranchhod, 2012; Bhorat et al., 2013 ). The main ﬁnd-
ings so far suggest (i) private households are very quick to ﬁnd sub-
stitutes as the relative costs of domestic workers increase due tominimum wages, (ii) on average minimum wage laws increase
wages for domestic workers even in the absence of full compliance
and (iii) there is little to no signiﬁcant impact on employment for
domestic workers. The empirical literature on the impact of mini-
mum wage laws for precise informal sectors such as domestic
work, is limited, largely owing to paucity of data and a lack of min-
imum wage legislation. Hence there is a need to expand minimum
wage studies for domestic workers in other developing countries
where they constitute a large proportion of informal employment.
The paper tries to ﬁll this gap by evaluating the labor market
impact of minimum wage legislation in the domestic work sectorfor a large developing country. The geographic focus of this paper
is India. India in general has been relatively understudied within
the minimum wage literature with very limited literature on the
labor market impact of minimum wages across both formal and
informal sectors.
2.2. Theoretical literature
The effects of the minimum wage legislation depends on the
labor market structure and enforcement rates. There are two con-
trasting predictions. First, if the labor market is perfectly compet-
itive one would expect an increase in wages and a decline in
employment ( Stigler, 1946 ). Second, in imperfect markets with
monopsony, employers might have a wage setting power unlike
competitive markets allowing them to pay wages to a worker
below his or her value of marginal product ( Stigler, 1946 ). Hence
introduction of a minimum wage legislation depending on how
large is the difference with prevailing labor market wages could
lead to an increase in employment. In other words given the degree
of monopsonistic power of the employer to set wages, a relatively
low minimum wage
vis/C0/C18a/C0visvalue of marginal product of the
worker, the employer can pay the minimum wage and still employ
more workers until the minimum wage is equal to the value of
marginal product. The increase in employment can vary from no
loss, negative or positive gains depending upon the characteristics
of the targeted work sector such as the degree of informality or
vulnerability.
In developing countries, low wage occupations such as the
domestic work sector are likely to be monopsonistic where
employers are more likely to have an inﬂuence in setting wages
due to (i) low skill requirements for the work involved, or (ii) high
costs involved in worker migration to high wage areas ( Coffey,
Papp, & Spears, 2015; Bryan & Morten, 2019 ).6This means any
effective wage or employment outcomes from minimum wage legis-
lation targeting the domestic work sector depends on the degree of
enforcement which pushes employers to comply with the minimum
wage rate. There are two possible outcomes in such a case.
First, if the minimum wage introduced is low and below a given
threshold, with enforcement, it would lower the ratio of the mar-
ginal cost of labor to the minimum wage, increasing employment
in the new equilibrium. However a high minimum wage above
the threshold would induce an increase in the ratio and hence
reduce employment in the new equilibrium, implying an inverted
V shaped relationship between employment and the minimum
wage distributions.7
Second, Basu et al. (2010) demonstrates that the enforcement
rate ( k, where 0 <k<1) (the probability of the employer being
inspected and any violation being caught) determines how theminimum wage affects the expected marginal cost and not the true
marginal cost.
8If enforcement is low we should observe negative or
5SeeBroecke et al. (2017) for a comprehensive review on the effects of minimum
wages on employment in emerging economies.6Monopsony in the context of the domestic work sector does not mean only one
buyer. It refers to monopsonistic competition where employer’s market power
persists despite competition with other employers given a large number of employerswith free entry ( Bhaskar, Manning, & To, 2002 ).
7SeeSoundararajan (2019) for a review of the theoretical relationship between
minimum wages and employment in low wage - imperfect markets as demonstrated
inBasu et al. (2010) .

the true marginal cost, where the weight is given by a monotonically increasingfunction of kas an interaction with h(Basu et al., 2010 ).hindicates the efﬁciency of
the judicial process and government bureaucracy ( Basu et al., 2010 ). This leads to two
key observations in the presence of a low minimum wage given a threshold ( Basu
et al., 2010 ): (i) a high kwould lower the ratio of the expected marginal cost relative
to the true marginal cost and hence increase employment for a wide range along theminimum wage distribution; (ii) if kis low, then the expected marginal cost would be
lower than the true marginal cost for a relatively smaller range of the minimum wagedistribution.R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943 3

null employment effects along with an increase in wages over a
wider interval of wage distribution. Further, ( Basu et al., 2010 )
shows that in the case of convergence of low enforcement (low val-
ues of k), imperfect competition and imperfect commitment by
Government, turning a blind-eye can indeed be the equilibrium. In
the case of domestic worker sector, these conditions set out by
Basu et al. (2010) seems to hold and help us to partly unravel the
mechanisms behind observed trends in wages and employment.
Hence, the paper provides evidence to verify these theoretical
predictions.
3. Details of the treatment
Until August 2019, the Minimum Wages Act of India 1948 leg-
ally granted a minimum wage for workers in activities listed in the
‘‘employment schedule” of the government, maintained by both
the central and state governments ( Soundararajan, 2019 ). Domes-
tic work is not part of this schedule maintained by the central gov-
ernment in India.
The lack of legal recognition of domestic work is not unique to
India ( D’souza, 2010 ). Some key features of domestic work differ-
entiating it from other similar low skilled informal occupations
are the following ( D’souza, 2010 ); (i) the employment relationship
is invisible or in other words it is often undeclared and has no writ-
ten contract involved; (ii) there is an unequal balance of power
between employer and employee; (iii) a lack of precise job descrip-
tion and (iv) the expectation on the part of the employer to be
available at all times.
In India, the main cited reasons for the exclusion of domestic
workers from the employment schedule are (a) potential large
scale loss of employment opportunities of domestic workers, (b)
the difﬁculty in enforcing the laws protecting the minimum wage
of the workers due to location of work being private space and (c)
the informal employment relation between the domestic worker
and the private household ( Neetha, 2009; Armacost, 1994 ).
However, State governments started taking measures to
improve the condition of domestic workers. By 2012, a total of
seven states implemented minimum wages for domestic workers,
namely, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh (AP), Bihar, Rajasthan,
Jharkhand and Odisha.9Of these states we focus our analysis on Kar-
nataka, which was the ﬁrst to institute minimum wages for domestic
workers in 2004 followed by Bihar and Andhra Pradesh in 2007 and
Rajasthan in 2008.10Among these four states, it was only in Karnataka and Andhra
Pradesh, that unions and organizations working among domestic
workers played a key role in bringing the sector under the purview
of the Act. The implementation of minimum wage laws in
Rajasthan and Bihar were more of a technocratic exercise and the
exact reason for their implementation remains unknown ( Neetha,
2013b ).11All these states deﬁne domestic work in terms of tasks
undertaken and the tasks are listed in their respective minimum
wage notiﬁcation. The tasks listed in the notiﬁcation vary from state
to state but in general they include cooking, cleaning and basic care
work.
The notiﬁcations on the minimum wages were rooted in
the societal understanding of domestic work ( Neetha, 2013 ).
For example, within the legislation domestic work is listed
as non technical and an unskilled occupation. Further, mini-mum wage rates are either ﬁxed for an hour or a day as
opposed to a monthly calculation. Appendix Table A-1 shows
that compared to the minimum wages for similar work in
hotel and restaurant sector, the stipulated minimum wages
for domestic workers are lower in most states. This resonates
with the societal devaluation of house-work as a non produc-
tive work in an unproductive work-space ( Sankaran, 2013 ).
Table 1 summarizes the variations in the legislation among
these four states.
4. Data and empirical strategy
4.1. Data
The paper uses the 55th, 61st, 64th, 66th and 68th rounds of
National Sample Survey (NSS) of India, which corresponds to1999, 2004, 2007, 2009, 2012 respectively in its main anlaysis.
Four states instituted minimum wage laws for domestic workers
namely: Karnataka, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan instituted
minimum wages between 2004 and 2009. All the four treatment
states notiﬁed minimum wages between 2004 and 2009. This pro-
vides two survey years prior to the treatment and two surveys post
treatment. We have two rounds of the national sample survey
(55th (1999) and 61st (2004) rounds) before the law was instituted
and two rounds of the survey (66th (2009) and 68th (2012)
rounds) after the law came into effect in these four states. The
64th survey round for 2007, with additional migration particulars,
is used for robustness checks.
The survey is at the household level and covers the whole of
the Indian Union. The data is reported by workers or their
household members, the wages reported by workers were not
veriﬁed hence the risk of over or under reporting holds for this
survey just like other national surveys. The sample size at state
level is in proportion to its population and at least 16 ﬁrst
stage sampling units in both rural and urban areas for each
state are included. This allows us to study impact of public
policies at state level. The empirical strategies described below
help address some of the key limitations of repeated cross-
sectional data.
4.2. Empirical strategy
The primary estimation strategy used is difference-in-difference
approach. While the treatment is at the state level the data is at the
individual-district level corresponding to each state. The following
difference-in-difference empirical model is used.9There are three more states namely Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Assam that
have included domestic work in their respective state list of scheduled employmentin 2007, 2008 and 2013 respectively but have not ﬁxed any wage rate. Chhattisgarh(2013), Jharkhand (2011) and Kerala (2011) have also extended Rashtriya SwastyaBima Yojana (RSBY), a health insurance scheme to domestic workers as the ﬁrst stepin widening the coverage of welfare schemes to this occupational group to domestic
workers. Haryana, Tripura, Dadar and Nagar Haveli had also announced minimum
wage for domestic workers by 2012. Our results do not change once we remove themin 2012 long run analysis in the paper (while keeping them in controls in earlierrounds).
10We exclude Kerala, Jharkand and Odisha as treatment from our analysis due to
several reasons. Kerala witnessed an informal norm of minimum wage standards for
domestic workers as early as in 1989 despite the ofﬁcial minimum wage beingnotiﬁed only in 2010 making Kerala a unique case when compared to the treatmentstates in our analysis. Hence we exclude Kerala entirely from our analysis. InJharkhand the minimum wage law was instituted only in 2010 and hence is used onlyin the control group until 2010 and dropped for later period. Until 2012 Odisha was inthe process of including domestic workers in the list of scheduled employment and aminimum wage was ﬁxed only after 2012. Hence, Odisha remains in the control group
in our anaylsis. Our survey data pertains to 1999, 2004, 2009 and 2012, hence we do
not have two post-treatment survey rounds for these states. Therefore, we alsoexclude Jharkhand from the control group in our long run analysis. By 2012, Haryana,Tripura, Dadar and Nagar Haveli had also announced minimum wage for domesticworkers. The results presented in the paper do not change once we remove them inlong run estimations (while keeping them as controls in earlier rounds).
11To rule out any resulting endogeneity of treatment due to these different
initiation process of treatment, within these two groups of states, the paper conductsanalysis separately for these two groups as robustness checks.4 R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943

Xidstrepresents different individual and household covari-
ates. It includes age, sex, marital status, education level, land
owned by household and a dummy variable distinguishing
between higher and lower caste categories. These variables
capture vulnerabilities associated with an informal sector such
as domestic work related to gender, youth, low education or
skills in the literature ( Menon & Van Der Meulen Rodgers,
2017 ). In addition, we also use the interactions between these
covariates in some of the speciﬁcations. The reason for con-
ducting regressions with interactions is that some of these
interactions will have very signiﬁcant impact on determining
the wage rates. For instance, gender and caste interaction termwill help capture any additional discrimination faced by
women of lower caste, compared to their higher caste counter-
parts. Various economic, social and cultural dimensions enters
the calculation of wages for domestic sector workers
(Sengupta & Sen, 2013 ) and these interaction terms help to
capture several of such factors.
The paper also adopts a combination of matching and
difference-in-difference approach to estimate the impact of
the minimum wage legislation in these states. For domestic
workers in the treatment states (those that instituted mini-
mum wage legislations), we ﬁnd counterparts in the same
states (treatment states) and non-treatment states, both before
and after treatment through a matching procedure. The differ-
ence in difference of the outcome variables between these
treatment and control group members before and after the
treatment, gives us a measure of the impact of the minimum
wage legislation.
The main advantage of combining the matching and
difference-in-difference methods (MDID) is to weaken the under-
lying assumptions of these two methods used separately. MDID
adopts a common trends assumption - had the treated remain
untreated they would have experienced the same change in out-
comes as that of the control groups ( Blundell & Cost Dias, 2009;
Blundell, Meghir, Costa Dias, & Reenen, 2004 ). Let tand t0be

observable characteristics, D¼1 indicates selection for treatment.
Y
0represents the outcome variable in the untreated state. So the
underlying parallel trends assumption of MDID and our basic
difference-in-difference estimation strategy translates to the
following.
EðY0t/C0Y0t0jX;D¼1Þ¼EðY0t/C0Y0t0jX;D¼0Þð 2ÞIn addition to the parallel trends assumption, MDID also require
the following common support assumption.
PðDit0¼1jX;tÞ<1 ð3Þ
With repeated cross section data (like in our case), we need to
ensure that the treatment group members have comparable coun-
terparts in all the three control groups namely - the treated before
treatment, untreated both before and after treatment. By estimat-
ing treatment effect on the treated via matching in the region of
common support we are able to reduce the bias due to non-
overlapping support. The primary common support is determined
where all observations with a propensity score smaller than the
minimum and larger than the maximum in opposite group were
deleted using the minima and maxima criterion.12
Heckman, Ichimura, and Todd (1997) cites some additional
advantages of MDID. It reduces the bias induced by different ques-
tionnaires likely to be used for treatment and control groups as
well as the bias caused by differing local market characteristics
of the control and treatment groups.13
The matching estimator of the treatment effect, aMDID, can be
represented as ( Blundell & Cost Dias, 2009; Heckman et al., 1997 ):

uted to individual jin group Gand time twhen compared with the
treated individual i,xiaccounts for the re-weighting that recon-
structs the outcome distribution for the treated sample.
Further, we use entropy balancing (represented as ebalance in
our estimation tables) as described in Hainmueller (2012) to sup-
plement the matching and DiD estimations. Entropy balancing pro-
cess ensures balancing of ﬁrst three moments of covariates
between the treatment and control groups. This is achievedthrough a data pre-processing methodology that relies on maxi-
mum entropy re-weighting scheme that calibrates unit weights
so that the re-weighted treatment and control groups have bal-
anced moments in terms of all covariates. Hainmueller (2012)
ﬁnds that this procedure can greatly reduce model dependence
of estimation of treatment effect.
In executing the MDID approach, the paper uses seven match-
ing algorithms, each with its own merit and limitation, as sum-
marised in Caliendo and Kopeinig (2008) . The algorithms used
are kernel density matching, nearest neighbor matching (with
and without replacement), nearest neighbor caliper matchingTable 1

we estimate the treatment effect on treated who falls in the region of commonsupport.

Ichimura, Smith, and Todd (1998) . In our case, both treatment and control group
members were instituted from the same survey questionnaires making such source ofbias unlikely.R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943 5

caliper matching.14Employing these different matching algorithms
provide robustness checks to the MDID approach.
In addition to the above estimations of impact of treatment. We
also study the impact of treatment intensity on the key outcome
variables. In the minimum wage literature, the treatment intensity
is most commonly quantiﬁed in terms of wage gap (WG), which is
the difference between the newly instituted minimum wages and
the median wages in the pre-treatment period.

The median weekly wages for treatment states appear to be
substantially lower than the instituted minimum wage rates.15
We adapt the MDID approach described in earlier sections to
take into account the impact of wage gap on the outcome variables
using the following empirical model.

tion of minimum wage legislation ( Kyears) based on the approach in

4.3. Sample selection and key variables
How do we identify domestic workers from NSS surveys?
Within the NSS surveys, there is an indicator under the enterprise
type which identiﬁes ‘private households employing maid servant,
watchman, cook, etc’. All workers engaged in this category can besafely classiﬁed as domestic workers. The wage rates and other
details of the workers are reported by the workers themselves,
hence, we can cast aside any reasons for potential exaggeration
of reported wages. The wage rate, is the total weekly wages
received (both cash and in kind) in the previous week. We convert
nominal weekly wages into real wages based on 2004 price
levels.
16Hence our main outcome variable is log real wage. Less than
3 % of the total data in our sample recorded zero values, hence these
observations get removed from our analysis when the log values of
wages are considered.We also study the impact of the legislation on employment
probability as domestic workers among the larger group of ‘casual
workers’ in the economy.
The matching of workers is implemented based on the follow-
ing covariates gender, age, marital status, dummy for lower caste
(whether belongs to scheduled caste (SC), scheduled tribe (ST), or
other backward classes (OBC)), level of education (illiterate, just
literate, primary, middle or higher education), and land owned
by the household.
We restrict our analysis on the impact of the minimum wage
law for domestic workers to urban areas in the state of Karnataka,
Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan.17
Table 2 compares the sample means for all the Indian States
before and after treatment.
5. Results
We analyze the impact of the minimum wage legislation for
domestic workers on two main outcome variables: log real wages
and employment probability. For both these outcome variables we
study the impact using three approaches explained earlier: normal
difference-in-difference, entropy balancing (ebalance), matching
with diff-in-diff (MDID) with different matching procedures includ-
ing kernel density matching, nearest neighbor matching (with and
without replacement), multiple nearest neighbor matching with
three neighbours and replacement (with and without caliper), cali-
per nearest neighbor matching (with and without replacement).
5.1. Impacts on wages
Table 3 provides the estimations for normal difference-in-
difference (DiD) estimations and entropy balanced (ebalance)
DiD estimations for all four treatment states. We ﬁnd statistically
signiﬁcant positive impact under both ordinary DiD and entropy
balanced procedures on real log wages in these treatment states.
The covariates affect the real wages in the expected direction.
For example, belonging to lower caste implied you earned lower
wages, while more educated workers received higher wages com-
pared to less educated counterparts. Estimations show that many
of these interactions are signiﬁcant in determining the bargaining
power and hence the wage levels of domestic sector workers.18The
positive impact of minimum wage legislation holds even in this
speciﬁcation which includes all interactions between relevantcovariates. For all these speciﬁcations we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant and pos-
itive impact of the minimum wage legislation on wages. The magni-
tude of the impact is also very similar.
We next employ the MDID approach to study the impact of
minimum wage legislation on real wages for domestic sector
workers, using various matching algorithms discussed in Sec-
tion 4.2. We match the treatment group members with counter-
parts from these states in the pre-treatment phase and we follow
the same procedure for control group members. The matching is
14Kernel density matching is a non-parametric matching which uses almost all
members of the control group, using appropriate weighting, to create a counter-factual. While nearest neighbor selects the member from the control group who isclosest to each treatment observation in terms of propensity scores. However, there isa risk that the nearest neighbor is in fact quite far in terms of propensity scores and itcan lead to bad matches. To correct for this, caliper matching allows to impose atolerance level on the distance (in this paper we uses a tolerance level of 0.01)
between the matched pairs. In all these cases, matching ‘with replacement’ refers to
the case when the observations from control group can be used multiple times tomatch with treated observations, while, ‘without replacement’ means this is notpermitted.
15We calculated the weekly minimum wages using 8 h work per day and 7 work
days per week. To construct the wage gap, the median weekly wages of each state for
the pre-treatment year 2004 were used.
16We use the food price index of the urban industrial workers provided by the
Reserve Bank of India to convert nominal wages to real wages.17We do not include rural areas for the following reasons, (i) domestic work is
primarily an urban phenomenon, (ii) due to the problems of enforceability ofminimum wage in rural areas, (iii) the National Rural Employment GuaranteeScheme (NREGS), which guarantees 100 days of employment in rural areas, was
introduced in many of the districts within these states since 2006. The scheme would
have had some impact on domestic workers in these rural areas as they were mostlikely to enroll in NREGS work simultaneously. Hence by including rural areas we runthe risk of not being able to distinguish between the impact of NREGS from that of theminimum wage legislation. In rural areas, domestic workers also do agricultural workand some of their tasks cannot be distinguished from agricultural laborers andsometimes they are paid mostly in kind, making the wage measures increasingly
prone to such errors.
18We do not discuss the signs and signiﬁcance of these covariates and their
interactions in this paper as they are not part of the key results. The detailed results oftheir impact can be provided upon request.6 R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943

carried out on all the covariates used in the normal DiD approach.
Since we have a repeated cross sectional data, this procedure
ensures that difference in difference is estimated using matching
of counterparts across different survey rounds, using a set of
observable characteristics. Table 4 gives the result of the MDID
estimation where we cluster the standard errors at state level. Sim-
ilar to the case of entropy balancing and DiD, we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
positive impact of minimum wage legislation on weekly real
wages. The results also hold for short run MDID estimates where
the standard errors are clustered and interactions between all
the covariates on which the data is matched are included as con-
trols.19We observe that there is a signiﬁcant positive impact of min-
imum wage legislation on weekly real wages. The magnitude of the
impact ranges from 0.32 to 0.49, all signiﬁcant at 1 % level, slightly
higher than the estimates of DiD estimation in Table 3 .Table 5 provide estimations of the long-run impact of the min-
imum wage legislation on real wages between 2004 and 2012. We
ﬁnd that the treatment impact has reduced in magnitude and is
statistically insigniﬁcant in the long run. We also use the MDID
approach and arrive at the exact same conclusion, as shown in
Table 6 . The results suggests that the impact of minimum wage
legislation in these four treatment states seems to have worn off
by 2012.
Why does the treatment effect disappear in the long run? While
we explore this question in detail in the Section 6, the results of the
treatment on employment probability as domestic workers dis-
cussed in the next section already provides some clue.
5.2. Impacts on employment
Exploring the impact of minimum wages on employment, we
ask whether the minimum wage legislation increases the probabil-
ity of being employed as a domestic worker? To study this, weTable 2

develop a dummy variable that indicates if the worker is a domes-
tic sector worker or not. As a comparator group, we include the
sample of all casual workers that could provide job alternatives
to domestic workers.20Casual workers are employed informally,
do not receive social security beneﬁts, consists mainly of people
from economically poorer and socially disadvantaged households,
engaged in irregular work, often compensated on a daily basis
(ILO, 2018 ). Hence, similar to domestic work on several counts. We
treat the dummy indicator variable as the outcome and apply a lin-
ear probability model, within the normal and entropy balanced DiD
frameworks described earlier. Table 7 and 8 provide the results. It
seems that there was a secular decline in the overall probability of
being employed as a domestic worker in India since 2004, denoted
by the negative and signiﬁcant coefﬁcient of the Post variable. How-
ever, the treatment effect is statistically insigniﬁcant implying that
there is no evidence of impact of minimum wage legislation on the
probability of being employed as a domestic worker.
In South Africa, Dinkelman and Ranchhod (2012) ﬁnd that
despite strong positive impact on wages of domestic sector work-
ers, there was no evidence of any impact at the extensive margin
following the minimum wage legislation. Our conclusions seem
to resonate with the South African evidence in this respect. Further,
it helps to partially rule out the possibility that the lack of signiﬁ-
cant impact on real wages in the long-run was due to changes in
employment options for workers. If workers had experienced a
higher employment probability as domestic workers following
the introduction of the minimum wage legislation, this would have
suggested an increased supply of domestic workers, which in turn
would have reduced the impact of minimum wage legislation on
wages in the long run. However, employment opportunities seem
to have not responded to the minimum wage legislation in either
the short-run or in long-run.5.3. Intensity of treatment
As explained in the earlier section, the minimum wages set by
the various treatment states differed in terms of hourly rates, the
method of calculation and the tasks included. Naturally, the differ-
ence between the pre-existing wages and the stipulated minimum
wages, which deﬁnes the treatment intensity, also differed across
these states. In this section we further analyze the impact of treat-
ment intensity on our outcome variables. The treatment intensity
is most commonly quantiﬁed in terms of wage gap (WG), which
is the difference between the minimum wages and the median
wages in the pre-treatment period, as explained in Section 4.2.
Table 9 and 10 gives the wage gap estimates using both the nor-
mal and entropy balanced DiD in the short-run and long-run,
respectively. We ﬁnd that the intensity of treatment led to a posi-
tive and statistically signiﬁcant increase in log real wages for treat-
ment states in the short-run. Higher the wage gap in the treatment
states, higher were the increase in real wages. But this impact
seems to attenuate in the long-run. This result holds with the
model speciﬁcation after including all covariates and their interac-
tions as well. Similar to the earlier case, there seems to be no
impact on employment probability.
However an important point to note is that minimum wages in
each of the four treatment states have been updated since their
respective state governments issued notiﬁcation for minimum
wages to domestic workers for the ﬁrst time. In the preceding anal-
ysis we used the minimum wages as updated until September
2012. While the use of the 2012 minimum wages is relevant for
the long run intensity of treatment (as in Table 10 ), we re-run
our short run intensity of treatment by creating wage gap variable
for each of the treatment states with minimum wages notiﬁed
until the year 2010.21We also run speciﬁcations by including state
dummies and interactions (both individually and together). The
short run impact remains positive and signiﬁcant as before. Further-
more using the 2010 updated minimum wages in order to calculate
the long run intensity of treatment does not change the results.Table 4

5.4. Wage distribution analysis
Comparing the actual wages obtained by workers with the
instituted minimum wages can shed light on the enforcement
levels and mechanism of impact. Figs. 1 and 2 provide the kernel
density plots of wage distributions of early adopter state (Kar-
nataka) and late adopter states along with applicable nominal min-
imum wages. The following key observations stand out, ﬁrstly, a
signiﬁcant proportion of wages occur below the minimum wage
levels, giving evidence of imperfect compliance. Secondly, in the
short run there is a movement of the wage distribution to the right,
while the distribution of wages shows a slight shift to the left in the
long-run. This is in line with what we observed using the
difference-in-difference estimations in terms of a short-run posi-
tive impact which disappears in the long run. Moreover, these dis-
tributional graphs shows wide-spread lack of enforcement of the
legislation, which we further explore as the potential mechanism
of the observed results in the next section. Further, Fig. 3 shows
the distribution in wages of control states, which do not show
any signiﬁcant shifts over the years.
6. Possible mechanisms
This section discusses the possible mechanisms that might help
explain the observed results. The estimations suggest that there
was a strong impact on real wages in the short-run but this impact
disappears in the long run, with no signiﬁcant effect on the
employment in short and long run. There are two potential mech-
anisms that can drive the result. The ﬁrst being supply side factors,
in which the higher minimum wages in treatment states led to
increased supply of domestic sector workers in these states (from
both inter-sector and inter-state migration of workers), leading
to gradual disappearance of differential trends in wages betweentreatment and control states.22While the second mechanism deals
with enforcement, where the lack of enforcement of the legislation
leading to a gradual disappearance of any positive ‘announcement
effect’ of the legislation on wages.
To uncover which of the potential mechanisms at play we con-
duct a spatial analysis of impact of legislation. The basic intuition
being any signiﬁcant ‘supply side’ effects of treatment will be more
prominent in the districts within the control group that are closest
to treatment states. We classify the districts within the control
groups according to their distance from the treatment states. Those
control groups that fall within a 250 km distance of treatment
groups (from the state borders) were called ‘near controls’, thosefurther than this distance are classiﬁed as ‘far controls’. If the sup-
ply side effects were at play, we would observe a different trend in
‘near controls’ as opposed to ‘far controls’. While this is an arbitrary
boundary limit, the results also hold with a non-arbitrary near and
far control grouping based on contiguous boundaries.
23
Fig. 7 , traces the movement of estimated mean wages in treat-
ment groups and distance classiﬁed control groups in 2004 (61st
round), 2009 (66th round) and 2012 (68th round). As shown by
the previous empirical analyses, the mean estimated wage of the
treatment group for the 66th round signiﬁcantly rises relative to
the real wages in the control groups when compared to the pre-
treatment 61st round. The ﬁgure clearly shows that the wages in
both the control groups (far and near) are on the rise between
2009 and 2012, while the mean wages in the treatment group
seem to have stagnated.
While, Fig. 8 plots the movement of employment probability. It
reveals similar trends in employment measure across the treat-
ment, near and far controls.Table 6

Similarly we also conduct spatial analysis on a proxy sector to
uncover any inter-sector supply effect, where the movement of
workers from other informal sectors to domestic work might have
led to the disappearance of positive impact on wages in the longrun. Fig. 9 , plots the movement of actual log real wages in domestic
work versus close substitute or placebo sector consisting of hotel

[Page 11 of 20]
(66th and 68th rounds), there seems to be a secular increase in real
wages when compared to the pre-treatment round (61st round).
This however is not the case with domestic work where the actual
wages seem to be stagnating between 2009 and 2012 similar to
Fig. 7 . Hence, our spatial analysis reveal no heterogeneous effects
for any of the outcome variables for near and far controls, pointing
at limited supply side factors.
The disappearance of the positive impact on treated wages in
the long-run in comparison to control states and proxy sector
can be due to two potential mechanisms. First, the signiﬁcant
short-run effect on wages observed in 2009 for the treatmentstates had a signiﬁcant impact on the labour supply in the control
groups and proxy sectors which led them to adjust wages upwards
in order to equalize wages with treatment states in the long-run.
Second, the legislation was not effectively implemented or
enforced in the treatment states and as a result the wages in the
treatment states stagnated in the long-run, following a short-
term surge after the announcement of minimum wages, while
the wages in the control groups gradually caught up with the trea-
ted states by 2012 given the rigidity associated with the informal-
ity of the domestic work sector. The gradual catch up of wages in
the control group relative to the treatment group might be a spillFig. 1. Distribution of nominal wages and minimum wage: Karnataka.
Fig. 2. Distribution of nominal wages and minimum wage: late treatment states.R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943 11
----------------------------------------

[Page 12 of 20]
over ‘numeraire’ effect of the minimum wage announcement in the
treated states ( Maloney, 2004 ).24
It is difﬁcult to delineate between these two potential mecha-
nisms due to paucity of panel data with employment history of
workers. However, evidence from the previous Section 5.2revealed
that there was no signiﬁcant impact of the legislation at the exten-
sive margin on the employment probability of domestic workers.
Further, there do not seem to be any difference in wage or employ-
ment trends between ‘far’ and ‘near’ controls, as we expect supply-
side effects to be more pronounced in ‘near’ controls. This seem to
reduce the possibility that any signiﬁcant supply-side adjustments
might have taken place as a result of the legislation.
We further study the impact of inter-state migration to treat-
ment states from control states. Unfortunately, migration details
of workers are included only in special rounds of NSS. We usethe available migration data for 2007 (64th round) to analyse the
general migration patterns of domestic workers. By 2007, Kar-
nataka had already implemented the minimum-wage law, we ﬁnd
that even in Karnataka the patterns of migration among domestic
workers followed the same pattern as the rest of the treatment
States. Tables 11 and 12provide the details on proportion of
migrant domestic workers and proxy workers (hotel and restau-
rant sector), in short-term (less than 1 year) and long-term (greater
than 1-year), for both Karnataka and control states. Here, migrants
are deﬁned as those workers who moved outside their home-
districts. It seems the proportion of migrants engaging in domestic
work is very low (less than 10 %). Out of these migrants, the major-
ity of workers are intra-state migrants both in domestic work and
proxy sector, with workers moving across state boundaries being a
minor fraction. Summarizing, the share of migrant domestic work-
ers, both intra-State and inter-State, is not signiﬁcant enough to
have any impact on state-wide wages in this sector. Additionally,
there are no signiﬁcant differences in migration particulars
between Karnataka and other states. So what impedes migration
of workers across states to take advantage of higher wages across
borders? This question was explored in detail by Kone, Liu,
Mattoo, Ozden, and Sharma (2018) , who attributes low rate of
inter-state migration in India to state-level entitlement schemes,
ranging from access to subsidized goods through the public distri-bution system to the bias for states’ own residents in access to ter-
tiary education and public sector employment. Hence, workers do
not want to move across borders in fear of loosing out of these
entitlements.
If not supply side factors, what could explain the short-run
surge and long-run stagnation of wages in treatment states? The
announcement of minimum wages in treatment states, often by
Ministers, gave the legislation a signiﬁcant media attention. In fact,
a survey conducted among employers in treatment states found
that media reports, newspapers and TV, were cited as the main
sources of information on minimum wages Neetha (2013a) . This
might have led to wage adjustment in treatment states as captured
by short-run analysis (between 2004–2009). Our analysis in Sec-
tion 5.4shows that majority of workers earned wages below the
minimum wages, hence lack of compliance was the norm. Further,plenty of qualitative evidence from the treatment states seem to
support the case for poor monitoring and implementation of the
legislation. Neetha (2013a) provides ample qualitative evidence
on weak enforcement of legislation from all the four treatment
states. Some of the key impediments to the enforcement that were
identiﬁed through interactions with labour ministry ofﬁcials,
domestic workers and union representatives ranged from the lack
of awareness about the provisions within the legislation among
workers and employers to restrictions on labour inspections at pri-
vate households. The weak enforcement of the legislation most
likely incentivized employers not to update the wages beyond
2009 allowing wages to stagnate in treatment states.
As illustrated in Section 2.2a plausible explanation for the same
can be found in Basu et al. (2010) which shows that turning a blind
eye to a minimum wage legislation by the very same government
which passed it can be an equilibrium phenomenon. The result
indicates that since credible enforcement most likely requires
costly ex-post transfer of income from employers to workers, a
government concerned only with pareto efﬁciency but not with
distribution is unable to credibly elicit efﬁciency improvements
via a minimum wage reform. Interestingly, congruent to these the-
oretical implication, in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the mini-
mum wage notiﬁcation for domestic sector workers came even
with the explicit guideline that employers are exempted from
Fig. 3. Distribution of nominal wages: control states.12 R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943
----------------------------------------

[Page 13 of 20]
maintaining records of employment. Also labour inspectors were
not allowed legally to inspect private households, and complaint
redressal and monitoring mechanisms were non-existent
(Neetha, 2013 ). This seems like a possible intervention by Govern-
ments to pacify employers of domestic workers, an illustration of
turning a blind eye. We ﬁnd no increase in the number of labour
inspectors in these States over the years (see Fig. 10 ), suggesting
no signiﬁcant efforts in improving of minimum wage compli-
ance.25As a result, the impact of legislation seems to have waned
off completely by 2012.
7. Robustness checks
7.1. Parallel trends
We ﬁrst test the crucial assumption of parallel trends. Fig. 4
shows the trend of average real wages in the pre-treatment period
(i.e., 1999 and 2004) and post-treatment period for both treatment
and control states.26The graph strongly supports the parallel trend
assumption, as well as the observed deviation in trends post-treatment. Fig. 5 provides similar plot for the employment measure
of probability of employment as domestic worker over 1999–2012.
We observe similar trends in employment probability in treatment
and control states both before treatment and after treatment. This
provides further evidence of lack of any supply side effects following
the implementation of the legislation.
7.2. Common support
The second assumption that MDID relies on is that of common
support, which translates to the fact that there is an adequate over-
lap of efﬁcient matches. We ﬁnd that common support assumption
holds in terms of each of our covariates and their interactions for
both our outcome variables. In addition, in all the MDID estima-
tions, the sensitivity of the common support region was checked
following methods in Black & Smith (2004); Heckman, Ichimura,
and Todd (1998b); Mizala et al. 2011 .27In addition, in all the MDIDFig. 4. Trends in estimated and real wages 1999–2012.
25InFig. 10 we scale the number of inspectors by the total number of sample urban
workers in each treatment state. This is because we do not have any information on
the size of the total informal labor workforce in each state.
26The ﬁtted values are estimated using a simple linear regression of real wages on
time and an intercept.27We use two methods to accurately determine the region of common support. First
all observations with a propensity score smaller than the minimum and larger thanthe maximum in the opposite group were deleted using the minima and maxima
criterion. This is the primary method operationalized earlier. Second, following
Heckman et al. (1998) , 5% of the observations with low density values were trimmed.
As a further robustness check we also trimmed 10% of the observations with lowdensity values, and following ( Black & Smith, 2004; Mizala, Romaguera, & Gallegos,
2011 ), we deﬁne a thick support region deﬁned by 0 :33<^pðxÞ<0:67. The results do
not change.The results can be presented on request.R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943 13

estimations, the balancing of the covariates between the treatment
and control groups were veriﬁed using the t-test. In order to ensure
that our results are not driven by any one particular state, we
remove one treatment state at a time and re-run our analysis and
ﬁnd that our results hold in all speciﬁcations.
7.3. Balancing test and checking for distributional shifts
As our estimation relies on propensity score matching, it is
important to verify that balancing conditions are satisﬁed by thedata and ensure the reliability of estimations. We conduct a set
of balancing tests following Girma and Görg (2007), Rosenbaum
and Rubin (1985), Smith and Todd (2005) as explained in appendix
section 2. The results of the balancing tests for the covariates in the
paper are given in Table A-13 . Across the four tests, the balancing
conditions are satisﬁed. The regression test proposed by Smith and
Todd (2005) also supports the balancing result as all the interac-
tion terms with the treatment dummy are jointly insigniﬁcant
for each of the covariates. We also check the sensitivity of propen-
sity score balancing between treatment and matched controls byFig. 9. Log Real Wages in Domestic vs Placebo Sector.

using various re-weighting schemes laid out in DiNardo, Fortin,
and Lemieux (1996), Nichols et al. (2008) , followed by joint hotell-
ing t-tests.28The results support a balanced sample across both the
treatment and control groups. We further check the robustness of
matching estimates to minor changes in the propensity score model
(Dehejia, 2005 ). The matching estimates also emerge robust to
changes in the propensity score model.
We follow the approach taken by Dinkelman and Ranchhod
(2012) to show that the shift in observable characteristics of the
domestic workers do not account for the signiﬁcant shift in wages
between 2004 and 2009. Following the same methodology as in
Dinkelman and Ranchhod (2012) appendix 2, Fig. 11 shows that
despite re-weighting the pre-treatment data with the post-
treatment distributional characteristics, the rightward shift in
wages after treatment persists in the short-run.7.4. State-time trends and non-linear marginal effects
Our diff-in-diff estimates suggests that there is a non-linear
effect of treatment between the short and the long run. Based on
the approach in Wolfers (2006) , we employ Eq. 7to estimate the
treatment effect on real wages from heterogeneity in effective
treatment years after pooling data from 1999, 2004, 2009 and
2012 survey rounds, while controlling for state-time trends.29
Fig. 6 shows estimates of non-linear marginal effects for incremental
increase in years from effective treatment. We ﬁnd that the marginal
effect from treatment in the short-run is positive and signiﬁcant
(years 1 to 3). However as the number of years increase beyond 3,
the marginal effect seems to become negative and insigniﬁcant, in
line with the main diff-in-diff results.
7.5. Placebo sector and alternate control group
We conduct further robustness check by running the exact
difference-in-difference estimations used to derive our main
results for a placebo sector. As stated in Section 6we select work-
ers in hotels and restaurants to be the placebo sector as their tasks
and even work timings are comparable to that of domestic work-
ers. If our main results hold, the difference-in-difference analysis
of the outcome variables (wages and employment) should not
show any signiﬁcant results for this placebo sector. We conduct
the normal diff-in-diff, ebalance and matching analysis and ﬁnd
that there is no statistically signiﬁcant treatment effect in the pla-
cebo sector. The diff-in-diff and ebalance results of this robustness
check is provided in Table A-3 and A-4 in the Appendix .30ThisFig. 10. Number of central labour inspectors per urban workers in treatment states.
Fig. 11. Re-weighted Wage Distributions.
28Results will be presented on request.29The state-time trends cannot be included separately using the difference-in-
difference main speciﬁcation, as the state-time trends will be collinear to thedifference-in-difference treatment estimate due to limited number of annual surveyrounds.
30Compared to the domestic work sector, we observe a smaller N and hence a
smaller degree of freedom in the placebo sector due to an increase in missingcovariates. Hence we re-estimate the diff-in-diff without including the covariates forboth the short and the long run. Table A-12 shows no statistically signiﬁcanttreatment effect in the placebo sector even with after a signiﬁcant increase in N. TheMDID results will be presented on request.R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943 17
----------------------------------------

[Page 18 of 20]
implies that the treatment effect was not capturing any macro-level
shock that affected all similar sectors in the treatment states during
the post-treatment period. This imparts further conﬁdence in our
identiﬁcation strategy’s ability to isolate the impact of the treatment
on domestic sector workers.
We also conduct similar analysis on the probability of being
employed in hotel and restaurants. We ﬁnd no treatment effect
on the sector at the extensive margin in the short-run, however
we ﬁnd a positive treatment impact in the long-run. Had this
effect been due to any shift of workers from hotel and restaurant
sector to domestic work then the effect would have been a neg-
ative. So the positive impact could be driven by a factor unre-
lated to the minimum wage effect. The results of these placebo
extensive margin analysis are included in Appendix Tables A-5
and A-6 .
In order to develop a more comparable control group, we
further restrict our control groups to untreated states that share
borders with treatment states and then re-run the analysis. The
diff-in-diff and ebalance results of this robustness check pro-
vided in Tables A-8 and A-9 in the Appendix clearly show that
after restricting the control group to the untreated border
states, we see a signiﬁcant treatment effect with similar signs
and magnitude on log real wages in the short run and no sig-
niﬁcant effect in the long run.31The increase in wages in the
short run or a3estimate including the MDID results ranges
between 0.26 to 0.33, which is similar to the increase in our
main results.
7.6. Gender
Domestic work sector in India is dominated by female workers,
so we conducted a sub-sample analysis for female workers. Our
results remain similar in magnitude and in statistical signiﬁcance
for this sub-group.
7.7. State and city level heterogeneity
Implementation capacity of states could be different, which
could hamper the implementation of any law. We looked at the
NREGS implementation performance reports of the four treat-ment states. Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan emerge as top per-
formers in terms of NREGS implementation, with Karnataka and
Bihar trailing behind ( Breman & Varinder, 2012 ). So we clubbed
together the two top-performers and repeated the analysis exclu-
sively for these two treatment states. We found that our results
did not vary from the main ﬁndings, suggesting that the mini-
mum wage law implementation did not vary signiﬁcantly in these
two states.
Further, using migration statistics from India, Imbert and Papp
(2016) show that the migration effect of NREGS on urban areas
affected mostly the male, short-term migrants who engaged in
mostly casual unskilled activities especially in construction and
manufacturing sectors. So the impact of differential implementa-
tion rates of NREGS during the initial phase of its implementation,
on domestic work sector dominated by women who tend to
migrate for long-term, would be limited.
Furthermore, to control for any differential impact due to scale
of cities, we estimate MDID short run estimates with city dummies
and the interaction terms as additional covariates (with clustered
standard errors). We create dummies for 10 big metros and include
it as additional controls in our regressions along with interaction
controls. The key results continue to hold.
327.8. Sensitivity to small number of clusters
Inference based on clustered-robust standard errors (CRSE) is
robust to both intracluster correlation and unknown heteroskedas-
ticity. However in setting such as ours where treated groups are
small in number, we check the sensitivity of the CRSE for the sta-
tistically signiﬁcant treatment effects on real wages.We employ a
Wild Restricted Efﬁcient bootstrap with weights from Webb’s six
point distribution discussed in Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller
(2008) and Roodman, Nielsen, MacKinnon, and Webb (2019) . The
last column in Table 4 gives the bootstrap p-values from the main
short run MDID estimations shown in the second column after
9999 replications. The results maintain a signiﬁcant treatment
effect on real wages in the short run. While last column in Table 6
shows an insigniﬁcant effect on real wages in the long run afterbootstrapping the results presented in second column of Table 6 .

8. Discussion and implications for future research
The main conclusion derived from the above analysis is that
minimum wage legislation for domestic sector workers seems to
have had a signiﬁcant positive impact in terms of real wages in
the short-run (by 2009), while there seems no evidence of signiﬁ-
cant positive impact on wages in the long-run (by 2012).
The estimated impact on log real wages is around the magni-
tude of 0.3, which translates to a 30 percent increase in real wages
approximately (in 2004 prices). This is a substantial increase in the
short run. However this impact of minimum wage legislation
becomes rather limited in the long run as the short run increase
in wages are not sustained after 2009. In fact in treatment states,
the domestic sector wages seem to have missed the secular rise
in wages observed in a close informal sector such as hotel and
restaurants across both treatment and control states. The paper
rules out the case of a supply-side adjustment as the driving factor
for this change and points at the direction of weak implementation
or enforcement of the legislation.
The paper also throws light on the question of how these min-
imum wages stood in comparison to the wage levels that existed in
these states before the implementation of the minimum wage leg-
islation. We ﬁnd that the pre-existing wages were considerably
lower than that of the introduced minimum wage. Hence, if the
minimum wage legislation was implemented properly, we would
have observed a signiﬁcant increase in real wages. The distribution
analysis revealed that majority of workers continued to get wages
lower than the minimum wages in the short and long run.
Our study suggests that legislation alone cannot make much
difference to the lives of informal sector workers such as domestic
work. A strong, transparent and efﬁcient monitoring mechanism is
crucial. Sengupta and Sen (2013) point to the fact that the mini-
mum wage laws protect the employers interests compared to that
of the domestic workers as the employers do not have to maintainregisters on wages given, nor create contracts with the domestic
workers. This certainly complicates the monitoring and enforce-
ment mechanism in this sector. Perhaps minimum wage legislation
should also make it compulsory to issue formal contracts to
domestic workers. Stronger formalization efforts need to accom-
pany these minimum wage legislation to increase the probability
of enforcement. This was the approach taken in Brazil, where min-
imum wage legislation for domestic workers was followed up by
efforts to increase formalization of the sector, especially by guaran-
teeing fundamental labor rights and mandatory registration of
labor cards of domestic workers. Subsequent to these efforts in
31The MDID results will be presented on request.
32The result tables can be presented on request.33We also estimate the bootsrap p-values for the short run wage effect in the
placebo sector as shown in Table A-11. The results remain insigniﬁcant.18 R.R. Gudibande, A. Jacob / World Development 130 (2020) 104943

[Page 19 of 20]
Brazil, between 2001 and 2009 the number of formalized domestic
workers increased by 30% in Brazil ( Gomes & Puig, 2013 ). Another
possible intervention is providing incentives for employers to com-
ply with the legislation. Incentives in terms of tax credits are used
in Belgium and France to increase compliance to regulations in
domestic work sector ( D’souza, 2010 ).
Placement agencies that recruit workers from rural areas to be
placed in urban households are emerging as key players. Regulat-
ing the work of these agencies through guidelines on placement
records and formal contracts could be a way of improving the
effective implementation of the minimum wage legislation. Fur-
ther, the Government of India has initiated a new universal identi-
ﬁcation scheme in terms of issuing biometric id cards (called
Aadhar cards) linked to bank accounts. In future, the payment of
domestic sector wages to the workers’ bank accounts could bemade mandatory, opening up further avenues to formalize this
sector.
In terms of future research, the impact of minimum wage legis-
lation on within state migration needs to be studied in more detail.
Another area for future research is the impact of union member-
ship of worker on wage bargaining.
9. Conclusion
This paper conducts an impact evaluation of the minimum
wage legislation for domestic workers in urban areas of four Indian
states. It tests the impact of the legislation at both intensive (real
wages) and extensive (employment) margins in both short-run
and in long-run. We ﬁnd that the minimum wage legislation had
positive and statistically signiﬁcant impact on real wages in the
short-run. The paper also ﬁnds a similar impact in terms of theintensity of the treatment itself, measured by wage gap. Higher
wage gap resulted in higher treatment impact in the short-run.
However, there seems no evidence of positive impact on real
wages by 2012. In the case of the probability of being employed
as a domestic worker, the legislation seems to have had no impact
in both short and long run. After considering supply side factors
including migration, the paper leans toward an absence of effective
monitoring and enforcement as the key driver of these results
based on available evidence. Qualitative evidence from the
ground-level analysis of these treatment states, ﬁnds that the leg-
islation was not accompanied by any strong enforcement and
monitoring mechanisms. As a result, the wages in treatment states
stagnated over the years, after the initial surge following the
announcement of minimum wages, while in the control groups
the wages gradually rose to catch-up with wages in treatment
states. The paper concludes with suggestions on improving
enforcement of minimum wage legislation for informal sectors
such as domestic work.

ABSTRACT 
 
The Effects of Vocational Training Programmes on the 
Duration of Unemployment in Eastern Germany 
 
This paper focuses on the effects of vocational training programmes on the duration of 
unemployment in Eastern Germany. We use in formation from administrative data of the 
Federal Employment Office. To allow for observable and possible unobservable influences 
we apply a multivariate mixed proportional hazard model. Furthermore, particular interest is 
spent on possible locking-in effects by separate estimation of in- and after-programme effects. Regarding several different programme durations our results show insignificant in- and after-programme effects for short-term programmes, insignificant in-programme and negative after-programme effects for mid-term programmes and negative in- and after-
programme effects for long-term programmes.

1. Introduction 2
1. Introduction
Unemployment is a serious problem for Eastern Germany. Its burden for the economy consists
not only in a reduced output and consequently a decreased welfare, but also a decay of human
capital. Therefore, an eﬃcient labour market policy has to aim at a continuous adjustment
of labour supply to the requirements of labour demand and a prevention of human capital
exhaustion by the provision of jobs or programmes that improve the individual qualiﬁcation.
The most important aim of active labour market policy (ALMP) is to increase the re-employment
chances of unemployed persons. In general, they consist of public employment services, labour
market training and subsidized employment. However, although ALMP have become more
important over the last two decades (see for example the EU Employment Guidelines or OECD
Jobs Strategy), there is no clear evidence for a general eﬀectiveness in the literature.1While
ALMP were seen as a panacea for the labour market in the early 1990s (as the political emphasis
reﬂects), recent studies disagree. The experiences of Calmfors, Forslund, and Hemstr¨ om (2002)
for Sweden show rather discouraging results from the eﬀorts of the implementation of ALMP
on a large scale. From their overview of several OECD countries, Martin and Grubb (2001)
deduce several reasons. One reason might be the rareness of evaluation studies and the fact
that they are mostly rather rigorous evaluations in the sense of only monitoring the outcomes
of participants. In addition, there is only very little evidence on long-run eﬀects. Since studies
are often evaluations of demonstration or pilot programmes, it is unclear how the eﬀects may
behave if programmes are extended to a larger scale. Furthermore, the utility of programmes
is interpreted in terms of impacts on future earnings and/or re-employment prospects in most
studies, and therefore they include no guidance for evidence on potential social beneﬁts. To
overcome these possible uncertainties, regular evaluation of the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of
ALMP is one postulation in the EU Employment Guidelines and is also anchored in the Social
Code III, the legal basis for ALMP in Germany. Anyhow, additional to that ALMP may also
be used to reduce unemployment, the deﬁnition of a adequate evaluation question might be
diﬃcult.
The most important instrument of ALMP in terms of ﬁscal volume and the number of promoted
individuals in Eastern Germany are vocational training programmes (Fortbildungs- und Weit-
erbildungsmaßnahmen, FbW). In 2000 there were 213,654 entries into the programmes and the
ﬁscal costs amounted to 2,748.1 million Euro (Bundesanstalt f¨ ur Arbeit, 2001). They aim at
the increase of the individual employment probability by qualiﬁcation transfer. Regarding the
tense situation of the Eastern German labour market, programmes are used on a large scale
to enhance the economic reorganisation by supply of qualiﬁed employees on the one hand, but
also to cushion the ongoing employment reduction on the other hand. Furthermore, the use of
vocational training programmes on a large scale may also impose spillovers and general equi-
librium eﬀects. If a large number of unemployed individuals are assigned to these programmes,
1See Hagen and Steiner (2000), Calmfors, Forslund, and Hemstr¨ om (2002) and Martin and Grubb (2001) for
an overview.

1. Introduction 3
the quantity of laborers with certain skills rises and is thereby likely to lessen its price relative
to a situation in which only a modest fraction of the unemployed receive such training (Lechner
and Smith, 2003). This might be also a reason for the bad picture in the literature.
In this paper we analyse the eﬀects of vocational training programmes on the individual tran-
sition from unemployment to employment in Eastern Germany. If the purpose of ALMP is
achieved by these programmes, there must be a positive eﬀect on the average unemployment
duration due to an increased employment probability. Our analysis is based on an inﬂow-sample
into unemployment in the last quarter of 1999 and the observations are followed until December,
2002.
Although there are several studies2for Eastern Germany that analyse the impact of vocational
training programmes, this is the ﬁrst study that applies a multivariate mixed proportional hazard
rate model in the timing-of-events methodology where the duration until regular employment
and training participation are simultaneously modelled. The primary advantage of this method-
ological setup is the consideration of the inﬂuence of potential unobservable factors. As there
might be participating individuals that have an a-priori high probability of leaving unemploy-
ment without training anyway, ignoring the resulting selectivity in the sample might lead to
biased results. Furthermore, it allows to examine the way how individual training eﬀects change
over time. Recently, the approach has been applied in a set of studies for other countries, like
Lalive, van Ours, and Zweim¨ uller (2002) for Switzerland, Richardson and van den Berg (2002)
for Sweden, Bonnal, Fougere, and Serandon (1997) for France, and van Ours (2000) for Slovakia.
A comprehensive survey on the methodology can be found in van den Berg (2001).
As noted above, vocational training programmes aim at the qualiﬁcation and re-qualiﬁcation
of unemployed persons. Due to that, completion of the programmes is more probable than
it is for other instruments of ALMP. Therefore, it has to be assumed that during programme
participation the exit probability from the programme and also from unemployment is lowered.
This eﬀect is called locking-in eﬀect.3In our empirical application we regard for this special
instance of vocational training programmes by estimating the in- and after-programme eﬀect
separately for diﬀerent programme durations and compare them to the estimates of a model
without this distinction.
The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section two gives some stylised facts of
vocational training programmes in Eastern Germany. The third section presents the econometric
methodology. In section four we describe the available data and show some descriptive results.
The results of our empirical application are given in section ﬁve. The ﬁnal section concludes the
paper.
2Hagen and Steiner (2000) give a survey on these studies including the applied methods and results.

2. Stylised Facts on Vocational Training Programmes 4
2. Stylised Facts on Vocational Training Programmes
The main purpose of ALMP is the permanent integration of unemployed and in particular
disadvantaged unemployed into regular employment, i.e. they should improve the matching on
the labour market. Following Calmfors (1994), the main functions are: First, adjusting the
individual qualiﬁcation to the demand of vacant occupations. Second, maintaining or increasing
the search eﬀorts of the unemployed. Third, participation as a substitute for regular employment
in the awareness of the demand side, i.e. a positive signal for the willingness to work and
productivity of the participant.
Vocational training programmes are primarily orientated according to the ﬁrst objective, but
might also achieve the others. They aim to adjust the individual qualiﬁcation to modiﬁed
requirements on the labour market in order to improve the employment probabilities. Alterna-
tively, they oﬀer a qualiﬁcation to individuals without a completed professional training. The
legal basis of vocational training programmes in Germany is §§77–96, 153–159, and 417 Social
Code III (SGB III). Unlike the former regulations in the Work Support Act (replaced by SGB
III in 1998), there is no distinction between further training and retraining measures. Financial
support is usually provided as a maintenance allowance and for the coverage of the direct costs
like course costs, learning material, travel costs, or costs for child care etc. Financial support
can be obtained by employed and unemployed workers, if the programmes are necessary in order
to bring the unemployed back to work or to avoid unemployment of someone directly threatened
by it, or to oﬀer a qualiﬁcation to someone without a completed professional training. The eli-
gibility rules for participation contain former episodes of employment, an individual counselling
and the approval of the scheme by the local labour oﬃce. Vocational training programmes
for individuals without completed professional training can also be oﬀered to individuals with
completed professional training but with no work experience in their profession for more than
six years. The ’former duration of employment’ rule is accomplished if the individual has con-
tributed at least for twelve months of the last three years to the unemployment insurance and
fulﬁls the eligibility rules for unemployment beneﬁts. Several exceptions reduce the strictness of
this rule. Full maintenance allowance is granted for individuals in full-time vocational training
programmes. Individuals who participate in part-time programmes can achieve partial mainte-
nance allowance. The duration of vocational training programmes that contain a professional
training should be up to two-thirds of the regular duration. Other programmes are in general
restricted to twelve months of promotion. Vocational training programmes must conclude with
a certiﬁcation that attests the job proﬁciency of the participant. The local labour oﬃces are
obligated to do quality checks of the courses.
Theoretically, vocational training programmes should positively aﬀect the individual’s qualiﬁca-
tion, productivity and thus the individuals set of attainable jobs. They should decelerate or even
reverse the decay of human capital during times of unemployment. Furthermore, they might
improve job search skills through preparation of job applications and interviews. Since long-term

unemployment may be regarded as a negative signal towards potential employers, interruption
of long-term unemployment episodes might help to prevent individuals from permanent ’scars’
(Wellner, 2000). On the other hand, participation is joined with individual costs, like hardship
of studying, course fees, travel costs, loss of income or leisure. As seen above, the labour oﬃce
provides ﬁnancial incentives or compensation for these costs.
There are a number of evaluation studies of vocational training programmes in Eastern Ger-
many. Hagen and Steiner (2000) provide a comprehensive overview. Unfortunately, the results
allow no clear tendencies for the eﬀects of the programmes. The majority of studies ﬁnd insignif-
icant or tightly negative results. Since vocational training programmes transfer qualiﬁcation,
participants normally do not leave these schemes before the regular end. Due to this, we have
to assume that the search intensity during programmes is reduced to a minimum. From their
overview and the results of an aggregated impact analysis, Hagen and Steiner (2000) conclude
that the extensive use of vocational training programmes in Eastern Germany raises the unem-
ployment. The programmes might also suﬀer from the systematic locking-in eﬀects. Thus, they
recommend shorter programme durations. This recommendation agrees with the conclusions
from international experiences. From their OECD countries experiences review, Martin and
Grubb (2001) note four crucial features for eﬀective training programmes: First, there should
be a tight targeting on participants, i.e. only people in need and with an expected gain from
participation should be treated. Second, programmes should be executed on a relatively small
scale. Third, since programmes include a further training or retraining of educated people,
they should result in a qualiﬁcation that is recognised by the market. Fourth, if the treatment
contains a strong on-the-job component, links to local employers could be established. In ad-
dition, Calmfors, Forslund, and Hemstr¨ om (2002) note that a rapid expansion of a programme
in the presence a very low labour demand, is likely to distort the programme incentives, if the
infrastructure of the programme is not appropriate. In their study for Sweden Richardson and
van den Berg (2001) suggest that the negative locking-in eﬀect more or less oﬀsets a positive
treatment eﬀect once the programme has been completed.
3. Econometric Methodology
The evaluation of the impact of vocational training on the inﬂow into regular employment is
done with a bivariate duration model. Normalising the point in time when an individual enters
unemployment to zero, we measure the duration until the individual enters a regular employment
Teand the duration until the individual enters a vocational training programme Tp.Teand Tp
are assumed to be non-negative and continuous random variables, where their realisations are
denoted with teand tp.
Basic assumption for the empirical analysis of vocational training is that the distribution of Te
is aﬀected by a treatment if this treatment occurs before te. Following Abbring and van den
----------------------------------------

[Page 8 of 23]
3. Econometric Methodology 6
Berg (2000), this assumption implies that the realisation tpaﬀects the distribution of Tein a
deterministic way from tponwards. The treatment eﬀect is then the causal eﬀect of Tpon the
distribution of Te|tpfort > t p(Abbring and van den Berg, 2000).
The durations Teand Tpare assumed to vary with observable characteristics xand unob-
servable characteristics veand vp. Following Abbring and van den Berg (2000), we assume
that Tp⊥ve|x, tp, vpand Te⊥vp|x, ve, which allows us to write the conditional distributions as
Te|tp, x, v eandTp|x, vprespectively. Although not necessarily the xare assumed to be the same
for both distributions, i.e. no exclusion restrictions on xare imposed.
In order to specify the model for the joint distributions Te, Tp|x, ve, vpwe focus on the conditional
hazard rates θe(Te|tp, x, v e) and θp(Tp|x, vp). The hazard rate is deﬁned as the probability of
exit from a state in a short interval of length dtafter t, conditional on the state still being
occupied at t, i.e. lim dt→0P r(t<T≤t+dt,T >t )
dt. The hazard rate speciﬁes fully the distribution of
the durations, where the survivor function is deﬁned as 1 −F(t) = exp( −/integraltextt
0θ(s)ds) and the
probability density function as f(t) =θ(t)(1−F(t)) (see Lancaster (1990) or Kalbﬂeisch and
Prentice (2000)).
For the speciﬁcation of the hazard rates we use a mixed proportional hazard model. Basic
feature of this model is that the duration dependence, observable and unobservable covariates
enter the hazard rate multiplicatively.
θe(t|tp, x, v e) =λe(t) exp[ x/primeβe+µ(t−tp)I(t > t p) +ve] (1)
θp(t|x, vp) =λp(t) exp[ x/primeβp+vp] (2)
The hazard rate for the transition into regular employment at time tconsists of the baseline
hazard λe(t) that determines the duration dependence, the systematic part exp( x/primeβe) that de-
termines the individual level of the hazard rate conditional on the observable characteristics and
the unobserved heterogeneity term exp( ve) that determines the level of the hazard conditional
on the unobserved characteristics. The treatment eﬀect exp[ µ(t−tp)I(t > t p)] with I(t > t p)
as an indicator function taking the value 1 if t > t p, is speciﬁed as a function of the diﬀerence
t−tp. In general we allow the treatment eﬀect to vary over the time after the treatment has
started.4This is useful if we think about a time-varying eﬀect of a treatment, for example due
to a locking-in eﬀect. The treatment eﬀect can be interpreted as a shift of the hazard rate by
exp(µ(t−tp)), that is directly associated with the expected remaining unemployment duration,
i.e. a positive treatment eﬀect will shorten the expected remaining unemployment duration. The
transition rate from unemployment into programme participation is analogously speciﬁed as a
4In the notation of Abbring and van den Berg (2000) the treatment eﬀect is also allowed to vary with the
moment of treatment and the individual characteristics x.

3. Econometric Methodology 7
mixed proportional hazard model with the baseline hazard λp(t), the systematic part exp( x/primeβp)
and the unobserved heterogeneity term exp( vp).
As stated by Abbring and van den Berg (2000) for the identiﬁcation of the treatment eﬀect, the
selectivity of the programme participation must be considered. Selectivity is present if individ-
uals with a relatively high transition rate into employment also have a relatively high transition
into programme participation. If we observe such a pattern this can result from two sources.
First, a positive treatment eﬀect rises for the group of participants the transition rate into regu-
lar employment. Second, individuals with treatment have a relatively high veand therefore have
a higher transition rate anyway. In the second case we obviously would observe a positive cor-
relation between veandvpand therefore a dependence between the indicator function I(t > t p)
and the unobserved heterogeneity term ve. Hence, if the possible dependence between veand
vpis ignored the estimate of the treatment eﬀect may be inconsistent (Abbring and van den
Berg, 2000). In order to account for the possible dependence in the unobserved heterogeneity
terms, we allow veand vpto follow an arbitrary joint distribution function G(ve, vp). Abbring
and van den Berg (2000) show that with assumptions similar to those made in standard uni-
variate mixed proportional hazard models, the bivariate model in (1) and (2) and especially the
treatment eﬀect is identiﬁed. The identiﬁcation is nonparametric, since it does not require any
parametric assumptions with respect to the baseline hazard and the unobserved heterogeneity
distribution (Abbring, van den Berg, and van Ours, 2000). Furthermore the identiﬁcation does
not require exclusion restrictions on xwhich are often hardly to justify from a theoretical point
of view.
The speciﬁed model for the transition rates θeand θprules out any anticipatory eﬀects of
vocational training programmes. An anticipatory eﬀect is given if the realisation tphas an
eﬀect on θebefore tp. This may be the case if the individual anticipates a future training and
may want to wait for the treatment by reducing his search activity (Richardson and van den
Berg, 2002). If anticipatory eﬀects of training programmes exists, our analysis would lead to
inconsistent results. However, the main eligibility criteria for vocational training in Germany
require that potential participants have small employment chances before treatment. Since
caseworkers have to place unemployed workers as early as possible into programmes, are obliged
to check potential alternative regular employment oﬀers, and the duration between informing
the participant about participation and the actual starting date of the programme is short, it
is unlikely that individuals voluntarily reduce their employment opportunities for a long period
only to obtain treatment.
A second type of ruled out anticipatory eﬀects result, if the individuals anticipate future realisa-
tions of Teand use this information to modify their optimal strategy, which in turn aﬀects the
current transition rate into programme participation θp(Richardson and van den Berg, 2002).
This is the case if an individual has private information about a future job opportunity and
therefore wants to avoid a training. Besides the ruled out anticipatory eﬀects, Abbring and
van den Berg (2000) note that there may be ex-ante eﬀects that are not ruled out by the model

speciﬁcation. If the individuals know the determinants of the distribution of Tpthey may adjust
their optimal behaviour in order to become more eligible for a treatment. Although such eﬀects
are not estimated by the model they does not lead to inconsistent estimates of the treatment
eﬀect. That is individuals are allowed to know the determinants of Tpbut not the realisations
ofTp.
The duration dependence is for both hazard rates speciﬁed as piecewise constant

(3)
where kis a subscript for the time interval and Ik(t) is an indicator function that takes the
value 1 if tlies in the interval k. The interval used for the analysis are 0-3 months, 3-9 months,
9-18 months and more than 18 months. As we include a constant term in the systematic parts
of both hazard rates we normalise λe,1and λp,1to zero.

In order to build the likelihood function for the estimation of the model we have to account
for censored observations. Thereby we allow only for right censoring, i.e. we only observe that
the spell has not been ﬁnished until t. Deﬁne the censoring indicators δeand δp, with δe= 1
(δp= 1) if te(tp) is right censored, the individual likelihood-contributions are given by:

4. Data and Descriptive Results 9
Following Heckman and Singer (1984), the arbitrary distribution function G(ve, vp) can be ap-
proximated by a discrete distribution with a ﬁnite number of support points. For the empir-
ical analysis we assume that G(ve, vp) has two points of support for each argument veand vp
with the associated probabilities π1=P(ve,1, vp,1),π2=P(ve,2, vp,1),π3=P(ve,1, vp,2) and
π4=P(ve,2, vp,2).
The individual likelihood contribution can then be written as:
le,p(t|x) =π1·/lscripte(t|tp, x, v e,1)/lscriptp(t|x, vp,1) +π2·/lscripte(t|tp, x, v e,1)/lscriptp(t|x, vp,2) (9)
+π3·/lscripte(t|tp, x, v e,2)/lscriptp(t|x, vp,1) +π4·/lscripte(t|tp, x, v e,2)/lscriptp(t|x, vp,2) (10)
The estimates are done with the method of maximum likelihood, where the probabilities of the
mixing distribution are speciﬁed as logistic probabilities,
π1=1
1 + exp( q1) + exp( q2) + exp( q3)π2=exp(q1)
1 + exp( q1) + exp( q2) + exp( q3)(11)
π3=exp(q2)
1 + exp( q1) + exp( q2) + exp( q3)π2=exp(q3)
1 + exp( q1) + exp( q2) + exp( q3), (12)
where q1, q2and q3are free parameters to be estimated.6The mass points for ve,1and vp,1are
normalised to zero since a constant term is included in both hazard rates.
4. Data and Descriptive Results
4.1. Data
Our empirical analysis is based on an inﬂow-sample of unemployment entrants in Eastern Ger-
many. The information is merged from several administrative sources of the Federal Employment
Oﬃce (FEO). These sources are the job seekers’ data base and an adjusted version for statistical
purposes that record the characteristics of all registered job seekers in Germany and is updated
monthly with information from the labour oﬃces. The data contains information on socio-
demographic characteristics, qualiﬁcation and placement restraints as well as a short labour
market history. In addition to that, we use data from the programme participants’ master data
set (MTG) to identify episodes of vocational training programmes. Our outcome of interest,
the transition to regular employment, is derived from an excerpt of the employment data base
6Alternatively the model could be estimated by a EM-Algorithm as suggested by Heckman and Singer (1984)
although the convergence speed is extremely slow.
----------------------------------------

[Page 12 of 23]
4. Data and Descriptive Results 10
which is the base for the individual pension claims and contains information on all episodes of
dependent employment.
Our sample consists of 30,539 individuals, who entered unemployment in the last quarter of
1999. These individuals are followed until December 2002. To avoid possible inﬂuences from
former ALMP programmes, we excluded 3,597 individuals who were participating in ALMP
before their current unemployment spell. Furthermore, 4,928 individuals participating in other
ALMP programmes during the observation period are excluded, since the number of individuals
in these programmes is too small for a reliable analysis. For homogeneity reasons we restricted
the sample to native Germans (352 dropped), without any health restrictions (3,013), and aged
between 20 to 50 (5,005). The remaining data contains information on 13,644 individuals.
For these individuals the labour market history in the observation period consists of four pos-
sible states: unemployment, employment, out of labour force and participation in a vocational
training programme. Since our focus is on the eﬀects of vocational training programmes on
the duration of unemployment, the unemployment ends if an individual ﬁnds a regular job or
leaves the labour force, i.e. for participating individuals the time of treatment is not excluded.
Thereby, we consider only those transitions to regular employment as a success, where the fol-
lowing employment spell lasts for at least six months, which is the usual probation period of an
occupation in Germany. This is reasonable because we are interested in the transition rate into a
regular and lasting employment. With this restriction, uncensored transitions into employment
can only be observed until June 2002.
The transition to programmes is measured in terms of the duration until the ﬁrst participation,
independent of the following treatment duration. Therefore, repeated participation (multiple
treatment) is not considered. The duration of unemployment teis right-censored, if the in-
dividual leaves the labour force within the observation period. If the unemployment spell is
continuing at the end of the observation window, the duration of unemployment is also right-
censored. Analogously, the unemployment duration until treatment Tpis right-censored if there
is no transition to a vocational training programme within the observation period, or if the spell
of unemployment ends before the programme starts, te< tp. As noted above, for censored ob-
servations we can only observe that the spell has not been ﬁnished until the censoring point. In
the data 27.77 percent of the individuals have censored unemployment spells until employment
(te) and 88.96 percent of the individuals have censored unemployment spells until treatment
(Tp), i.e. we observe 1,506 individuals participating in a vocational training programme.
4.2. Descriptive Results
Non-parametric estimates of the transition rates into regular employment and programme partic-
ipation are given in ﬁgure 1. The transition rate into regular employment rises at the beginning
of the unemployment spell up to 18 percent and falls gradually back to 2 percent afterwards.
----------------------------------------

[Page 13 of 23]
4. Data and Descriptive Results 11
The hazard rate for the transition into programmes oscillates relatively constant between zero
and 2 percent for the observation period.
Fig. 1: Non-Parametric Estimates of the Transition Rates to Programme and
Employment
As noted above, eligibility for participation refers with exceptions to former employment and
completed professional training. Due to that, these characteristics might inﬂuence the propen-
sity to participate. Furthermore, since the duration of unemployment depends on the individual
placement restraints, we employ a set of relevant observable characteristics. These characteristics
include dummies for females (FEMALE), whether or not the individual is married (MARRIED),
the former profession in terms of the occupational group (OG1-OG5), the educational degree
(PT1-PT5), and present work experience of the individual (TENURE). Further variables re-
garded for the empirical application are the number of children (NOKIDS), the individual’s age
in January 2000 (AGE), the duration of the last employment spell (DUR EMP), and the number
of placement propositions by the local labour oﬃce (PLACPROP).
The six occupational groups are jobs in agriculture, plant cultivation and ﬁshery industry (OG1),
miners and mining industry (OG2), manufacturing professions (OG3), technical occupations
(OG4), and services (OG5). The reference category for these variables is other professions .
Since a higher educational degree implies a higher value of the worker’s human capital, we
consider six types of diﬀerent educational groups. The reference category are individuals without
any professional training and without General Certiﬁcate of Secondary Education (CSE). The

second class are individuals that also miss a completed professional training, but hold a CSE
(PT1). Individuals with industrial training are outlined as PT2. People who exhibit a full-time
vocational school degree are included in PT3. Category PT4 contains workers with polytechnic
degree. The highest human capital value conditional on the educational degree is assumed for
the last category. It contains all individuals with college or university certiﬁcates.

Table 1 shows some descriptive results for these characteristics for the total sample and the
treatment and non-treatment group separately. While the majority of variables denotes no clear
diﬀerences between participants and non-participants, some particularities should be recognised.
First, the proportion of women in the participating group is about ten percent higher than
in the group of non-participants. This might reﬂect a possible gender discrimination in the
employment probabilities due to lower employment probabilities for women and consequently a
higher degree of necessary promotion by vocational training programmes. Second, comparing
the duration of the last employment spell before unemployment shows a longer mean duration for
the participating group. A possible reason could be the eligibility criteria for participation that
rely on an existent professional degree and contributions to the unemployment insurance. Third,
----------------------------------------

[Page 15 of 23]
4. Data and Descriptive Results 13
even though the shares of individuals from the mining industry and technical occupations are
small in the population, the proportions in the treatment group are twice respectively one and
a half as much as in the non-treatment group. This is not surprising since vocational training
programmes should assist the structural reorganisation of the labour market. Unfortunately,
from the review of the observable characteristics, expecting per se diﬀerences in the labour
market outcomes for participants and non-participants besides the fact of participation is not
possible. But on the other hand it reﬂects the need for consideration of further unobservable
inﬂuences.
Regarding the already mentioned locking-in eﬀects of vocational training programmes, the dis-
tribution of the durations of the programmes requires special interest. As noted above, courses
in general last for twelve months or in cases of programmes with professional training degree up
to two thirds of the regular duration. Figure 2 depicts this distribution. Obviously, the majority
of courses in our sample last no longer than twelve months. Furthermore, we can identify three
peaks in the period up to this point. A share of 11 percent lasts no longer than one month,
programmes with a duration of six months amount to 13 percent of the sample and the modus
is at twelve months with a proportion of 15 percent.

5. Empirical Analysis 14
5. Empirical Analysis
The empirical analysis is separated into two steps. First, we estimate the eﬀect of vocational
training on the transition rate into regular employment with a basic model where the treatment
eﬀect is speciﬁed as a permanent shift of the hazard rate. The analysis of the basic model enables
us to investigate the general eﬀect of vocational training as well as the issue of selectivity with
respect to programme participation. Second, we estimate an extended model that allows for a
time varying treatment eﬀect, in order to analyse the in-programme and after-programme eﬀects
separately.
For the basic model the treatment eﬀect is assumed to be of the from exp[ µI(t > t p)]. In this
case the hazard rate shifts permanently by exp( µ) if the individual starts treatment. In order to
assess the problem of selectivity with respect to the programme participation, we compare both,
the estimation results of the model with unobserved heterogeneity and of the model without
unobserved heterogeneity. For the estimation of the model without unobserved heterogeneity ve
and vpare restricted to zero, i.e. only one point of support for mixing distribution is imposed.
Table 2 presents the estimation results for the basic model without unobserved heterogeneity
and the basic model allowing for unobserved heterogeneity. Considering the coeﬃcients of the
observable characteristics on the transition rate into regular employment we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant
higher exit rate for married persons and individuals with work experience and a signiﬁcant lower
exit rate for females. The hazard rate declines with the age, the number of children, the duration
of the last employment spell and the number of placement propositions.
Turning to the coeﬃcients for the occupational groups, we ﬁnd remarkably larger coeﬃcients for
the model accounting for unobserved heterogeneity. For both models we ﬁnd the highest exit rate
for the individuals out of the agriculture and ﬁshing industry. With respect to the educational
degree we ﬁnd the largest exit rate for individuals with a polytechnical degree followed by the
college and university graduates.
For the transition rate into programme participation we ﬁnd a higher transition rate for married
persons and individuals with work experience. Furthermore the transition rate into programme
participation declines with the age and rises with the number of children, the duration of the last
employment spell and the number of placement propositions. With respect to the occupational
groups we ﬁnd the largest transition rate for the unemployed from the mining industry. This
may primarily result from the fact that vocational training in Eastern Germany is extensively
used to retrain workers from the mining industry. Regarding the coeﬃcients for the educational
degree we ﬁnd the largest transition rate for individuals with a full time vocational degree,
followed by individuals with a industrial training. The results show that vocational training
is primarily assigned to individuals with a usual vocational degree and not to highly or lowly
educated individuals.
The treatment eﬀect estimated from the model without unobserved heterogeneity is with µ=
----------------------------------------

[Page 17 of 23]
5. Empirical Analysis 15
−0.93 negative and signiﬁcant. Since exp( −µ) = 0 .3945, the transition rate is permanently
reduced by 60 percent at the point in time the individual enters treatment. Allowing for unob-
served heterogeneity the negative eﬀect becomes much stronger with exp( −µ) = 0 .1746. Hence
accounting for unobserved heterogeneity the hazard shifts by more than 80 percent. The clear
diﬀerence between both treatment eﬀects indicates that selectivity is relevant.
Considering the distribution of the unobserved heterogeneity term we ﬁnd only for 6.2 percent of
the individuals a low transition rate into employment and a high transition rate into programme
participation ( ve1=−8,009, vp1=−7,924). Therefore, individuals with low labour market
opportunities seem to be less eligible for programme participation. 36 percent have for both
transition rates simultaneously a low heterogeneity term ( ve1=−8,009, vp2=−10.891). A
positive selection can be found for 19 percent of the individuals, where people with good labour
market opportunities are more often selected to participate in vocational training programmes
(ve1=−5.386, vp1=−7,924). Finally 38 percent have good labour market opportunities
but have a low transition rate into programme participation ( ve1=−5.386, vp1=−10.891).
The programme selectivity is stated more explicitly by the fact that nearly 75 percent of the
individuals with a high transition rate into programme participation have also a high transition
rate into regular employment.
The so far estimated treatment eﬀect is a constant shift of the hazard rate from the beginning of
the training programme. But if we think of a locking-in eﬀect such a speciﬁcation is not useful.
The locking-in eﬀect results from a reduced search activity during the period the individual
is participating in the programme. Therefore it is reasonable that we distinguish between an
in-programme eﬀect and an after-programme eﬀect. For the following we assume that for the
period the individual is placed into the programme the hazard rate shifts by exp( µ1). At the
point in time the individual leaves the programme and becomes unemployed again we assume
the hazard rate is shifted by exp( µ2). With this assumption the treatment eﬀect is given by
exp[µ1I(tp< t≤tp+c) +µ2I(t < t p+c) where cdenotes the programme duration.
If the programme duration is determined by the individual labour market performance, the
identiﬁcation of the in-programme and the after-programme eﬀect would again suﬀer from a
selectivity problem with respect to the programme duration. In order to avoid this selectivity
we restrict the analysis to those programmes, where the programme duration is equal to a
predetermined length, e.g. 6 months. That is, we exclude all individuals from the data that
are participating in other programmes and specify cas a constant equal to the predetermined
programme duration. In this case cis a constant and therefore the identiﬁcation of µ1and µ2
depends only on the variation of tp.
Our analysis will cover short term programmes (1 to 3 months), medium term programmes (6
months) and long term programmes (12 months). Due to the small number of participants,
it was necessary to include diﬀerent programme length’s for the analysis of the short term
programmes. Therefore we cannot identify the in-programme and the after-programme eﬀect

for these programmes directly. However, setting c= 3 we can distinguish the eﬀect for the ﬁrst
three months after the programme has started and the eﬀect for the period 3 months after the
programme has started. For the analysis of the medium term programmes we set c= 6 and can
therefore distinguish directly between the in-programme eﬀect exp( µ1) and the after-programme
eﬀect exp( µ2). Analogously we analyse the long term programmes with c= 12. The number of
observations, participants and censored spells for the restricted data is given in table 3.
The estimation results for the short-term, medium term and long-term programmes are presented
in table 4. Comparing the estimates of the extended model and the basic model we ﬁnd especially
for the transition rate into programme participation larger coeﬃcients and larger standard errors.
These diﬀerences primarily result from the relatively small number of participants in extended
models. With respect to the transition rate into employment these diﬀerences are only marginal.
More interesting are the diﬀerences in the treatment eﬀect between the diﬀerent programme
durations and the basic model.
For the short-term programmes we ﬁnd for both, µ1andµ2, an insigniﬁcant eﬀect. Thus, short-
term programmes do not have an negative impact on the hazard rate in the ﬁrst 3 months.
This can be seen as an evidence that short-term programmes do not suﬀer from a locking-in
eﬀect. As the programmes are even ineﬀective for the period where all programmes have expired,
short-term vocational training seems not to be able to aﬀect the unemployment duration.
For the medium term programmes we do ﬁnd a negative signiﬁcant in-programme eﬀect and an
insigniﬁcant after-programme eﬀect. Therefore, vocational training programmes with a duration
of 6 months have a strong locking-in eﬀect. Unfortunately they are not able to compensate this
negative eﬀect, because after the completion of the programme the participants have the same
transition rate as non-participants.
Finally long-term programmes have negative signiﬁcant in- and after-programme eﬀects. Hence,
long-term vocational training programmes rise the duration of unemployment for the partici-
pants. Furthermore it should be noted that the negative locking-in eﬀect is stronger than the
negative after-programme eﬀect.
Summarising the results of this section we ﬁnd that vocational training generally rises the
unemployment duration of the participants, i.e. has a negative eﬀect on the individual level.
This is especially stated by the negative estimate of the basic model. The further analysis of the
extend model shows that a locking-in eﬀect of vocational training is a serious problem especially

for medium- and long-term programmes. But even if the analysis accounts for locking in eﬀects
the results show that vocational training is at best ineﬀective.
6. Conclusion
Vocational training is the most important instrument of active labour market policy in Eastern
Germany. Considering the tense labour market situation in Eastern Germany and the large scale
of vocational training programmes the question of the eﬀectiveness has become most important.
The empirical analysis investigates whether vocational training programmes are able to reduce
the unemployment duration of the participants. This is done with a bivariate mixed proportional
hazard model in the timing of events methodology, where the transition rate into employment
and programme participation is simultaneously modelled. Possible selectivity problems with
respect to the programme participation are solved by allowing the transition rates to depend on
observable and unobservable characteristics.
The empirical analysis with a basic model where the treatment eﬀect is modelled as time in-
variant shift of the transition rate, shows a negative and signiﬁcant eﬀect of vocational training
on the transition rate into employment. Since vocational training aims at qualiﬁcation or re-
qualiﬁcation a completion of the programmes is most likely. Therefore, the locking-in eﬀect may
be a major problem of the programmes. In order to account for the locking-in eﬀect we use an
extended model that allows for diﬀerent in- and after-programme eﬀects. The analysis with the
extended model is separated into an analysis of short term programmes with a programme dura-
tion of 1 up to 3 months, medium term programmes (6 months) and long term programmes (12
months). The results from the extended model show that short term programmes do not suﬀer
from a locking-in eﬀect but are generally incapable of shortening the unemployment duration.
Medium term programmes have a strong locking-in eﬀect that is not compensated by a positive
after-programme eﬀect. Finally, long term programmes have a negative in- and after-programme
eﬀect, i.e. generally lead to a rise of the unemployment duration. Our results show that the
locking-in eﬀect is a serious problem of medium and long term vocational training programmes.
Furthermore, the after-programme eﬀect of all programmes is at best insigniﬁcant.
Considering our results it should be noted that the negative eﬀect may result from the actual
labour market situation in Eastern Germany. The unemployment problem in Eastern Germany
primarily results from a shortage of the labour demand that cannot be counteracted by a measure
that aims at adjusting the structure of labour supply to the requirements of the labour demand.
Therefore, vocational training seems not to be a well-suited measure to ﬁght the unemployment
problem in Eastern Germany.

Employment  eﬀects a b s t r a c t 
We assess the short-term  employment  eﬀects of the introduction  of a national  statutory  minimum  wage in Ger- 
many in 2015. For this purpose,  we exploit variation  in the regional  treatment  intensity,  assuming  that the 
stronger  a minimum  wage ‘bites’ into the regional  wage distribution,  the stronger  the regional  labour market will 
be aﬀected.  In contrast  to previous  studies, we construct  two regional  bite indicators  based upon detailed  individ- 
ual wage data from the Structure  of Earnings  Survey (SES) 2014 and combine  it with administrative  information  
on regional  employment.  Moreover,  using the Socio-Economic  Panel (SOEP), we are able to aﬃrm the absence 
of anticipation  eﬀects and verify the assumption  of a common  trend in wages before the reform. In sum, we ﬁnd 
only moderate  negative  eﬀects on overall employment  of about 140,000  (0.4%) jobs, which are mainly driven 
by a sharp decline of marginal  employment  (‘mini-jobs’),  while we do not ﬁnd pronounced  signiﬁcant  eﬀects for 
regular employment  in most speciﬁcations.  Our results are robust to a variety of sensitivity  tests. 
1. Introduction  
In January  2015, the German  labour market was exposed  to a mas- 
sive intervention  in its wage structure  with the introduction  of a national  
statutory  gross minimum  wage of €8.50 per hour applying  to nearly all 
employees.  The introduction  of the minimum  wage was preceded  by 
a long debate among German  economists  and policy-makers  about its 
potential  risks and beneﬁts.  Advocates  emphasised  the primary  policy 
targets of poverty  prevention  and inequality  reduction  ( BMAS, 2014; 
Bosch, 2007; Kalina and Weinkopf,  2014 ), while opponents  stressed  the 
economic  burden of the reform.  Due to its high level and –w i t h only 
a few exemptions  –universal  character,  it was expected  to aﬀect more 
than one in ten employees  in Germany,  potentially  leading  to extensive  
job destruction  ( Knabe et al., 2014; Müller and Steiner,  2010; 2011; 
2013; SVR, 2013; 2014 ). Accordingly,  the aim of our paper is to exam-

in the short run. 
In theory, the potential  eﬀects of minimum  wages on labour demand  
depend  on the market structure.  While negative  employment  eﬀects 
are expected  in a competitive  price-taker  setting,  a monopsonistic  
labour demand  does not imply negative  eﬀects in general.  Depending  
on the minimum  wage level, the demand  for labour may increase  when 
employees  are paid below the marginal  product  of labour. Moreover,  
the time frame in which employment  eﬀects should arise has not 
been determined  and other adjustment  channels  might be used in the 
short run to postpone  displacements,  e.g. working  hours ( Stewart  and 
Swaﬃeld,  2008 ), proﬁts ( Draca et al., 2011 ) or simply non-compliance  
( Metcalf,  2008 ). Identifying  employment  eﬀects is therefore  an empiri-  
cal question  that has been addressed  with a variety of strategies  and –in 
most cases –has come up with no or weak negative  employment  eﬀects 
( Card and Krueger,  1995; Neumark  and Wascher,  2007 ). Unfortunately,

due to the universal  validity  of the reform,  the set of empirical  iden- 
tiﬁcation  strategies  is considerably  restricted  in the German  case. We 
base our analysis  on the approach  suggested  by Card (1992) , which 
relies on the degree to which regional  labour markets  are aﬀected  by 
the minimum  wage. Between  regions,  earnings  and wages diﬀer due 
to structural  and environmental  diﬀerences.  This variation  implies  that 
a nominal  minimum  wage aﬀects regions  to diﬀerent  intensities.  The 
stronger  that a minimum  wage ‘bites’ into the regional  wage distri- 
bution,  the stronger  the regional  labour market is aﬀected.  We adapt 
this approach  to the German  case and apply a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  
framework  to analyse  short-term  eﬀects of the minimum  wage on 
employment  for the ﬁrst year after the policy reform.  
Since the deﬁnition  of the treatment  indicator  –i . e . the degree to 
which a region is aﬀected  by the minimum  wage –is crucial to our iden- 
tiﬁcation  strategy,  we construct  two commonly-used  bite measures:  the 
Fraction  and the Kaitz index . The Fraction  reﬂects  the share of aﬀected  
eligible  employees  per region, while the Kaitz index displays  the relation  
of the minimum  wage to the regional  mean wage. Moreover,  the con- 
struction  of the regional  bite also calls for a deﬁnition  of a suitable  area 
classiﬁcation.  We rely on 141 distinct  regional  labour markets  (RLMs)  
as proposed  by Kosfeld  and Werner  (2012) . Since this approach  aggre- 
gates areas according  to economic  performance  and commuter  ﬂows 
even across federal states, it allows constructing  credible  RLMs. We draw 
upon data from the comprehensive  Structure  of Earnings  Survey (SES) 
2014, which contains  detailed  individual  information  on wages, work- 
ing hours and minimum  wage eligibility.  Therefore,  we are able to com- 
pute precise bite measures  based on the regional  hourly wage distribu-  
tions. This is a crucial advantage  to previous  studies (e.g. Garloﬀ,  2016 ) 
which relied on monthly  income  of full-time  workers  only, imposing  
strong assumptions  on distributions  of hours and wages. This is to say, 
as opposed  to data from previous  studies,  the SES enables  the derivation  
of precise bite measures.  
The minimum  wage introduction  was preceded  by a legislative  pro- 
cess that allows for potential  anticipation  eﬀects, which have largely 
been neglected  by previous  studies on Germany.  Since our identiﬁcation  
strategy  depends  on the assumption  that wages would have developed  
equally  among low- and high-bite  regions  in the absence  of the minimum  
wage reform,  we have to test the notion that wages were not adapted  
in anticipation.  For this purpose,  we need to make use of data on the 
pre-treatment  period. Unfortunately,  the SES is only available  every four 
years. Therefore,  we additionally  employ  the German  Socio-Economic  
Panel (SOEP),  which is smaller  in sample size but conducted  every year. 
With the annual SOEP data, we can consider  hourly wages in a time 
frame before the minimum  wage was decided  upon, allowing  us to ex- 
plore wage eﬀects and their potential  anticipation.  The bite measures  
constructed  with SES and SOEP display  strong positive  correlations.  Ac- 
cordingly,  despite the SOEP’s smaller  sample size, its measures  identify  
a similar variation  in regional  treatment  intensity  compared  with the 
SES indicators.  The pre-treatment  analysis  reveals no anticipatory  ef- 
fects, meaning  that prior to the reform wages followed  the same trend 
across regions  with diﬀerent  treatment  intensities.  However,  with the 
policy reform,  the share of individuals  earning  less than the minimum  
wage substantially  decreased  in aﬀected  areas, while the mean wage –
and thus the Kaitz –has hardly been aﬀected.  
For our estimation  of employment  eﬀects, we combine  our bite mea- 
sures with administrative  data on employment  stocks from the Federal  
Employment  Agency  (‘Bundesagentur  für Arbeit’,  FEA), measuring  the 
development  of employment  from 2012 onwards.  As a ﬁrst step we 
look at overall employment.  Out of 37.4 million  employed  individu-  
als in 2014, about 4 million  were eligible  for the minimum  wage and 
earned less than €8.50 gross per hour. The degree to which workers  
are aﬀected  varies strongly  with their employment  type. Employees  in 
full- and part-time  employment  (throughout  the paper also called ‘reg- 
ular employment’  that entails social security  contributions)  are gener- 
ally less aﬀected  by low wages than people in marginal  employment.  
Marginal  employment  (also called ‘mini-jobs’)  is a speciﬁc  type of em- ployment  in Germany  with an income  of up to €450 per month,  which 
is exempted  from income  taxation  and requires  (almost)  no employee-  
sided social security  contributions,  while the employer  pays 30% ﬂat 
charges.  To disentangle  eﬀects on the regular  employed  from eﬀects on 
the generally  more aﬀected  marginally  employed,  we additionally  look 
at both employment  subtypes  separately  in a second step. In sum, we 
ﬁnd a small but signiﬁcant  reduction  in overall employment,  indicating  
that an increase  of one percentage  point in the bite indicator  is accom-  
panied by an employment  reduction  of 0.03%. This is foremost  caused 
by a reduction  in marginal  employment  rather than a decrease  of full- 
and part-time  employment.  While we do not ﬁnd pronounced  eﬀects 
for regular  employment,  marginal  employment  reduced  by 0.18% per 
percentage  point increase  in the bite indicator.  These results are robust 
across all speciﬁcations  and a variety of sensitivity  tests. Our results are 
roughly  in line with the previous  literature  on short-term  employment  
eﬀects in Germany,  indicating  that adaptation  within the extensive  mar- 
gin of labour demand  was less strong than expected.  Using employer  
survey data, Bossler and Gerner (2016) ﬁnd that the minimum  wage led 
to the absence  of about 60,000 new hirings,  while Garloﬀ(2016)  –also 
applying  the identiﬁcation  strategy  by Card (1992) –identiﬁes  no eﬀect 
on regular  employment,  but ﬁnds evidence  of a shift from marginal  to 
regular  employment.  When we predict the average  employment  eﬀect 
that results from these estimations,  we ﬁnd that roughly  140,000  jobs 
(0.4%) were lost in total. 
The remainder  of this paper proceeds  as follows.  Section  2 intro- 
duces the legal framework  of the German  minimum  wage and discusses  
expectations  and previous  ﬁndings.  Section  3 considers  the identiﬁca-  
tion strategy,  its implementation  and our data sources.  Subsequently,  
Section  4 displays  the descriptive  results for our bite measures  and the 
employment  data, while Section  5 presents  the main analysis  of employ-  
ment eﬀects as well as robustness  analyses  and considerations  about 
possible  channels  and dynamics.  Finally,  Section  6 concludes.  
2. Institutional  details  and expectations  
Institutional  details. On January  1, 2015, the Minimum  Wage law 
(‘Mindestlohngesetz’)  entered  into force, introducing  a minimum  wage 
of €8.50 gross per hour. Until then, wage ﬂoors were set by collec- 
tive, voluntary  agreements  within speciﬁc  sectors.  1 The formal de- 
cisions about future adjustments  to the minimum  wage are to be 
made by the German  Minimum  Wage Commission  (‘Mindestlohnkom-  
mission’).  In light of minor short-term  employment  eﬀects, the Mini- 
mum Wage Commission  has recommended  raising the statutory  min- 
imum wage by 34 cents per hour starting  from January  1, 2017 (see 
Mindestlohnkommission,  2016a ). 
With the 2015 regulations,  almost any employee  in Germany  is el- 
igible for the minimum  wage. Restrictions  have only been introduced  
with respect to two dimensions.  First, speciﬁc  groups are excluded,  
namely  the self-employed,  trainees,  speciﬁc  types of interns 2 , minors 
without  vocational  training,  volunteers  and the long-term  unemployed.  
Second,  albeit temporarily,  sector-speciﬁc  minimum  wages under the 
national  level of €8.50 remained  valid until December  2016 and had to 
be adjusted  afterwards.  The exemption  for the long-term  unemployed  is 
rarely drawn upon ( vom Berge et al., 2016c ) and only few sector-speciﬁc  
1 Sector-speciﬁc  minimum  wages had been introduced  over the last two 
decades in several sectors, including  the construction  sector or the rooﬁng sector 
(in 1997), hair dressing  (in 2013) and security services (in 2011). Most sector- 
speciﬁc minimum  wages are higher than the statutory  minimum  wage and have 
been increased  after the uniform  minimum  wage ( Amlinger  et al., 2016 ). See 
Fitzenberger  and Doerr (2016) for an overview.  
2 Interns are excluded  if the internship  is compulsory  (‘Pﬂichtpraktikum’),  
is either a voluntary  accompanying  or voluntary  orientation  internship  (‘frei- 
williges Orientierungspraktikum’  or ‘freiwilliges  ausbildungsbegleitendes  Prak- 
tikum’) that lasts less than three months or if it is an entry-level  qualiﬁcation  
(‘Einstiegsqualiﬁzierung’).

minimum  wages have been below the minimum  wage ( Amlinger  et al., 
2016; Mindestlohnkommission,  2016b ). Nonetheless,  the exception  for 
trainees  and adolescents  reduces  the number  of eligible  individuals  to a 
great extent. Table 1 summarises  the number  of beneﬁciaries.  In 2014, 
about 5.5 million  employees  earned less than €8.50 per hour, of which 
4.0 million  (72%) were eligible  for the minimum  wage ( Destatis,  2016a ). 
The timeline  of the minimum  wage introduction  allows for potential  
anticipation  eﬀects, which previous  studies on Germany  have largely 
neglected.  In September  2013, the German  parliament  (‘Bundestag’)  
was elected.  Given that the major centre-left  wing party (SPD) an- 
nounced  their uncompromising  stance for a universal,  nationwide  min- 
imum wage of €8.50 per hour, the inclusion  of such a policy in the 
coalition  contract  with the major centre-right  wing party (CDU/CSU)  in 
December  2013 was commonly  expected.  Announced  as a high-priority  
project in January,  the law was then passed by the two German  parlia- 
ments in July 2014. These decisions  may have had instantaneous  eﬀects. 
According  to Bossler (2017) , employers  aﬀected  by the minimum  wage 
reported  greater employment  uncertainty  in summer  2014. The poten- 
tial anticipation  of the new regulations  could thus have aﬀected  employ-  
ers’ behaviour  even before the minimum  wage introduction.  Therefore,  
in Section  4 we examine  the bite indicators  in the pre-treatment  period. 
Expectations  and previous  ﬁndings.  The wage ﬂoor of €8.50 places 
Germany  in the middle of the international  minimum  wage ranking  
( OECD, 2015 , p. 37). Expectations  on its eﬀects on employment  were 
predominantly  negative,  even though both theory and empirics  are not 
conclusive  on this topic (see Neumark  and Wascher,  2008; 2007 ). For 
the long run, ex-ante  simulations  predicted  a reduction  of 500,000  to 
900,000  jobs, while positive  eﬀects on poverty  prevention  are small due 
to the German  in-work  beneﬁts  regulations  and withdrawal  rates from 
80 to 100% for households  with low income  ( Knabe et al., 2014; Müller 
and Steiner,  2013 ). Then the reform has little impact on the budgets  of 
employees  but relaxes the public budget constraints.  The largest impacts  
on earnings  are to be expected  in East Germany,  for women  and mini- 
jobbers  since a great share of the beneﬁciaries  belong to one of these 
groups (see Table 1 ). In fact, 2.2 million  (55%) of the 4 million  beneﬁ- 
ciaries were marginally  employed.  Moreover,  one in ﬁve East-German  
residents  earned less than the new wage ﬂoor in 2014, whereas  only 9% 
within West Germany  were aﬀected.  Diﬀerences  in earnings  also arise 
with respect to gender,  since over 60% of all eligible  employees  who 
earned less than €8.50 were women  ( Destatis,  2016a ). 
To shed more light on our target variable,  Fig. 1 shows the employ-  
ment level between  2012 and 2015 (see Section  3.3 for a data descrip-  
tion). First, we look at overall employment,  which follows  a seasonal  
trend but, in general,  has been increasing  over the last years. Secondly,  
we also distinguish  between  regular  and marginal  employment.  This is 
due to the fact that mini-jobs  hold special interest  within the discussion  
about the minimum  wage introduction  since they display  a high share of low hourly wages (see Table 1 ). Fig. 1 a and b show that the increase  
in overall employment  before 2015 is caused by a rise in both consid-  
ered employment  types. However,  only regular  employment  continued  
to increase  after the minimum  wage introduction.  While in the second 
quarter  of 2012 29.1 million  people were regularly  employed,  this num- 
ber had increased  by 1.5 million  three years later (see Fig. 1 a). Hence, 
from this descriptive  perspective  it does not seem as if the minimum  
wage aﬀected  regular  employment.  In comparison,  marginal  employ-  
ment, which was following  the upwards  trend of regular  employment  
(see Fig. 1 b) before the reform,  hardly changed  from 7.7 million  to 7.65 
million  after the minimum  wage introduction,  giving a ﬁrst descriptive  
indication  that it was aﬀected  diﬀerently.  This is likely a consequence  
of the special regulations  on marginal  employment.  
Marginal  employment  is deﬁned  by a monthly  income  below €450 
and can either be pursued  as a primary/sole  or a secondary/add-on  
job (although  mini-jobs  as add-on jobs are less frequent  as indicated  
by Fig. 1 b). They require  almost no employee-sided  social security  con- 
tributions  and are exempted  from income  taxation,  which is why gross 
income  is nearly equivalent  to net income  for marginally  employed.  3 
The employer  has to pay a linear income  tax rate of 2% and social se- 
curity contributions  of approximately  30%. 4 However,  when exceeding  
the mini-job  threshold  a worker can switch to a ‘midi-job’,  which is de- 
ﬁned by an income  between  €450 and €850. Then, the employers’  social 
security  contributions  are reduced  to the general  amount  of about 20%. 
For the employees,  however,  they follow a progressive  design until the 
standard  ﬂat rate is reached  at the upper threshold  of the midi-job.  More- 
over, if it is an add-on job or the spouse is working,  income  taxes have 
to be paid as well. For these reasons,  many marginally  employed  do not 
want to change their employment  status. However,  with the minimum  
wage introduction  and the corresponding  wage eﬀect, some will exceed 
the threshold  if their working  hours are not reduced  simultaneously.  
This transition,  however,  does not necessarily  entail more net income  
for workers  as they start to pay taxes and social-security  contributions.  
Especially  add-on jobs lose their ﬁnancial  attractiveness  as taxes and so- 
cial security  contributions  are paid in full. Sole mini-jobbers  might take 
this chance to increase  their labor supply since they exceeded  the mini- 
job threshold  anyway.  But, since sole mini-jobs  are typically  chosen due 
to a limited time budget (e.g. by mothers)  extending  labor supply is 
often not desired  ( Bachmann  et al., 2017 ). 
In sharp contrast,  employers  beneﬁt from transferring  mini-jobs  into 
midi-jobs  as their marginal  social security  contributions  are strongly  re- 
duced as soon as employees  enter a midi-job.  In that sense, an increasing  
gross wage can lead to a decrease  in total labor costs for the employer  
which is why transitioning  workers  to a midi-job  might be beneﬁcial  to 
them. A reduction  in mini-jobs  thus does not necessarily  result in ris- 
ing unemployment,  but may actually  be associated  with a demand  side 
favoured  increase  in regular  employment.  The ﬁrst evidence  on such a 
substitution  is discussed  by vom Berge et al. (2016a,b)  . To investigate  
such possible  eﬀects we will not only look at overall employment  but 
also distinguish  between  eﬀects on regular  and marginal  employment  
separately  in the empirical  Section  5.1 . Unfortunately,  our aggregate  
data does not allow to directly  estimate  transitions.  We will therefore  try 
to give some insight into potential  underlying  channels  in Section  5.3 . 
In accordance  with the descriptive  perspective  from above, the lit- 
erature  does not substantiate  the huge negative  employment  eﬀects 
that were foretold  in ex-ante  predictions  (see Bossler and Gerner,  2016; 
Garloﬀ,  2016 ). Applying  the same identiﬁcation  strategy  as we do, 
Garloﬀ (2016)  does not ﬁnd any overall employment  eﬀects, but a 
shift from mini-jobs  to part-time  employment.  He calculates  that about 
66,000 mini-jobs  were lost after the reform.  However,  since he has no 
information  on working  hours, the analysis  relies on strong assumptions  
3 Mini-jobbers  are required  to pay contributions  to the social pension fund but 
can be liberated  from that obligation  upon request.  
4 Contributions  are smaller if the employer  is a private household.

when calculating  the regional  bite indicator.  Due to a lack of working  
hours in the data, he determines  workers  to be paid below €8.50 per 
hour when they earn less than €1,400 a month,  thereby  assuming  that 
full-time  employees  work 38 hours a week. This is a strong assumption  
which neglects  the fact that full-time  employment  has a wide range of 
working  hours. 5 Moreover,  the analysis  thereby  completely  disregards  
part-time  and marginally  employed,  although  they exhibit a vastly dif- 
ferent wage distribution  and are typically  much more aﬀected  by low 
wages. These limitations  can cause a measurement  error that biases 
the estimates  towards  zero. Using employer  survey data, Bossler and 
Gerner (2016) identify  that 60,000 fewer jobs were created  within ﬁrms 
aﬀected  by the minimum  wage between  2014 and 2015. 
3. Identiﬁcation  strategy,  empirical  approach  and data sources  
3.1. Identiﬁcation  strategy  
The literature  on minimum  wage evaluation  has used and discussed  
a variety of identiﬁcation  strategies  for the causal evaluation  of aggre- 
gated short- and long-term  employment  eﬀects. However,  a large part 
of the previous  studies relies on legislative  variation  in the minimum  
wage regulation.  This identiﬁcation  approach  is not applicable  to the 
German  case, though,  since there is no legislative  variation  between  
federal states. Moreover,  exempted  sectors and individuals  diﬀer sub- 
stantially  from their aﬀected  counterparts.  6 
Therefore,  we follow Card (1992) who proposes  an alternative  iden- 
tiﬁcation  approach  using regional  variation  that does not depend  on dif- 
ferences  in legislation  (for applications  in the UK see Dolton et al., 2010; 
Stewart,  2002 ). Conceptually,  the intensity  with which wages need to 
change in accordance  with a minimum  wage introduction  is heteroge-  
neous between  areas. Where minimum  wages ‘bite’ hard, adaptations  in 
wages will be stronger  and so should be the adaptation  of labour de- 
mand. This approach  is applicable  to the German  context  and will be 
pursued  in the subsequent  analysis.  With 2015 as the year of the mini- 
mum wage introduction,  the following  structural  model summarises  this 
relationship:  
Δ𝑊 𝑗, 2015 = 𝛼+ 𝛽𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑗, 2014 + 𝑢 1 ,𝑗 (1a) 
5 Full-time  employment  is deﬁned as working  at least 30 hours a week. How- 
ever, many contracts  ﬁx the number of weekly working  hours to 40. 
6 The exempted  sectors are the meat processing  industry,  hairdressers,  agricul- 
ture and forestry sectors and –in East Germany  only –temporary  employment  
(‘Leiharbeit’)  and textile producers.  Δ𝐸 𝑗, 2015 = 𝛾+ 𝜂Δ𝑊 𝑗, 2015 + 𝑢 2 ,𝑗 , (1b) 
where ΔW j , 2015 describes  the changes  in aggregated  wages for region 
j between  2014 and 2015, i.e. Δ𝑊 𝑗, 2015 = 𝑊 𝑗, 2015 − 𝑊 𝑗, 2014 . The wage 
change during the minimum  wage introduction  depends  on three ele- 
ments: the average  change ( 𝛼), the lagged minimum  wage bite in area 
j ( Bite j , 2014 ) and an error term ( u 1, j ). Following  Card (1992) , 𝛽then 
describes  the average  eﬀect of the minimum  wage on wages. However,  
Bite j , 2014 does not aﬀect employment  ( E j ) directly.  Given a labour de- 
mand elasticity  of 𝜂, only ΔW j is transferred  to employment  changes.  
Substituting  Eq. (1a) into (1b) emphasises  this relation,  i.e. 
Δ𝐸 𝑗, 2015 = 𝛾0 + 𝜂𝛽𝐵 𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑗, 2014 + 𝜖𝑗 , (2) 
with 𝜖𝑗 = 𝜂𝑢 1 𝑗 + 𝑢 2 𝑗 and 𝛾0 = 𝛾+ 𝜂𝛼. The product  𝜅= 𝜂𝛽can then be in- 
terpreted  as the causal eﬀect of the minimum  wage on employment.  
3.2. Empirical  approach  
Based on Eq. (2) , we estimate  employment  eﬀects in accordance  with 
Card (1992) and Stewart  (2002) . However,  while they look at changes  in 
the employment-to-population  ratio, we decided  to use the log employ-  
ment level as the dependent  variable.  This is because  the employment-  
to-population  ratio not only reﬂects  changes  in employment  levels, but 
also changes  in the population,  which held particular  relevance  in 2015 
due to a large inﬂow of migrants.  We thus analyse  the log employment  
level but include  population  levels as a control variable  in our speciﬁ-  
cations below (and test the robustness  of this approach  extensively  in 
Section  5.2 ). 7 Furthermore  and in advantage  of the stylized  model from 
above, estimations  do not need to be restricted  to the year of introduc-  
tion. Additional  years may be included  in order to control for antici- 
pation and contradiction  with the common  trend assumption.  Then, in- 
stead of using the change in employment  as left hand side variable,  ﬁxed 
7 Highly-aﬀected  areas underlie  a signiﬁcant  reduction  in population  until 
2014, while population  grows in high-wage  areas. In light of the increasing  
number of refugees,  the negative  trend in low-wage  areas stopped,  although  the 
diﬀerences  between  areas prevail from 2014 to 2015. Although  the inﬂow of 
migrants  increases  the population  size, most of them were not allowed to work 
yet, such that the absolute  employment  level is most likely not as aﬀected.  They 
are likely a result of the migration  from the countryside  to urban areas, as well as 
the migration  from East to West Germany.  Nonetheless,  not controlling  for these 
diverging  trends may lead to wrong presumptions  regarding  the employment  
eﬀects, which is why further analysis  needs to control for population  size.

eﬀect estimations  on employment  levels are a more appropriate  choice 
as they control for time persistent  characteristics  best. Accordingly,  the 
annual log employment  level is estimated  by: 
𝐸 𝑗,𝑡 = 𝛾𝑗 + 𝛾′𝑇 𝑡 + 𝜃′
1 𝑇 𝑡 ×𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑗, 2014 + 𝛿𝑋 𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜐𝑗,𝑡 , (3) 
where E j, t denotes  the log employment  level (either for overall,  marginal  
or regular  employment  as will be explained  in Section  5.1 ) in period t, 
𝛾j a region-ﬁxed  eﬀect, X j,t a set of regional  controls  and 𝜐𝑗,𝑡 the error 
term. T t denotes  a year vector, which we expand  from the years around 
the minimum  wage (2014 and 2015) to 2013 and 2012 to evaluate  the 
identifying  common  trend assumption  (which we also discuss graphi-  
cally in Section  4.2 ). The model estimates  the reform’s  eﬀect based on 
the pre-treatment  bite in year 2014. 
The deﬁnition  of Bite j is crucial to the analysis,  which is why the lit- 
erature  discusses  several alternatives.  Most prominent  is the Kaitz index 
( ‘Kaitz’ ), which measures  the ratio between  the minimum  wage and the 
regional  mean wage. The higher the Kaitz, the stronger  that the min- 
imum wage bites. However,  its development  is not exclusively  deter- 
mined by changes  caused by the minimum  wage. Movements  in other 
parts of the wage distribution  also aﬀect this indicator.  Card (1992) , 
Stewart  (2002) and Dolton et al. (2015, 2010, 2012) rely on the share 
of the employed  population  earning  less than the minimum  wage ( ‘Frac- 
tion’ ). In contrast  to the Kaitz, this deﬁnition  rather focuses  on the group 
of aﬀected  individuals.  It depicts how many of the working  population  
eligible  for the minimum  wage are actually  aﬀected  by it. However,  
please note that the fraction  neglects  the density  below the wage ﬂoor 
since the low-wage  employed  aﬀect the indicator  independently  of their 
distance  to the threshold.  Therefore,  the suitability  of Fraction  and Kaitz 
as a treatment  intensity  indicator  hinges on the assumption  that the rel- 
ative wage distribution  below €8.50 per hour or below the mean wage, 
respectively,  is similar among all regions.  We construct  both bite mea- 
sures on a scale from 0 to 1 and include  them in our analysis.  To evaluate  
the general  robustness  of our approach,  we will also test binary speci- 
ﬁcations  of the bite measures  as well as diﬀerent  bite deﬁnitions  in the 
later sensitivity  analysis  in Section  5.2 . 
3.3. Data sources 
To identify  the minimum  wage eﬀects on the basis of regional  vari- 
ation, we need comprehensive  wage data on the eligible  population  as 
well as employment  stocks on the regional  level. Moreover,  to control 
for pre-treatment  trends we need data from the years 2012 to 2015. 
Thus, our analysis  combines  diﬀerent  data sources,  taking advantage  of 
the diﬀering  scopes of the data sets. For our employment  measures,  we 
rely on administrative  information  provided  by the FEA (2016) . How- 
ever, the wage data is drawn from two diﬀerent  sources,  given that we 
need extensive  data both in terms of the time frame and concerning  the 
number  of observations.  The longitudinal  design of the SOEP allows us 
to test our identifying  assumptions  for the pre-treatment  period. How- 
ever, our identiﬁcation  strategy  requires  computing  the regional  average  
wage for a multitude  of regions  and the number  of participants  in the 
SOEP does not ensure a suﬃcient  sample size per region. This is why we 
use the SES data for our analysis,  which is considerably  larger in sample 
size but only takes place at a four-year  interval.  
Wage data . To evaluate  the minimum  wage introduction,  the avail- 
ability of comprehensive  information  on earnings  and working  hours 
is crucial.  Since the policy reform targets hourly wages, corresponding  
data is needed  for the calculation  of the bite. Additionally,  marginally  
employed  persons  should be identiﬁable  in addition  to full-time  em- 
ployed,  since they compose  the most aﬀected  groups.  Moreover,  the 
proposed  diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  approach  relies on a common  trend 
assumption  with respect to wages. Information  on the bite is thus not 
only needed  during the reform,  but also before any potential  anticipa-  
tion took place, which is why longitudinal  data is needed.  In the German  
case, one can rely on diﬀerent  alternatives  with respect to regional  wage 
data. In previous  studies (see Garloﬀ,  2016 ), administrative  data such as the remuneration  statistic  (‘Entgeltstatistik’)  has been used to derive re- 
gional bite levels. 8 Unfortunately,  these statistics  do not include  detailed  
information  about working  hours. Hence, either full-time  employment  
with the same number  of working  hours has to be assumed  for every- 
body or working  hours have to be imputed.  However,  neither  solution  
has been shown to provide  a precise measure  of hourly wages. 
An alternative  source of individual  wage data is the SES 2014. 9 It 
is an employer  data set with more than 70,000 ﬁrms with one mil- 
lion workers  overall.  In April 2014, representatively-chosen  ﬁrms were 
legally obliged  to provide  detailed  information  on the income  and work- 
ing hours of their employees  (and thus the data does not suﬀer from 
systematic  bias caused by the sampling  process  or non-response).  Due 
to its scope, the SES is perfectly  suited to aggregate  individual  wage 
data at any regional  level to derive precise bite measures.  Although  the 
SES is considered  only representative  at the level of federal states, it 
still contains  considerably  large sample sizes in our classiﬁcation  of 141 
RLMs. 10 Unfortunately,  the SES only takes place at a four-year  interval.  
Thus, only data from the year prior to the minimum  wage introduction  
is available,  which makes it impossible  to analyse  short-term  changes  in 
bites or wages or to test for anticipation.  11 
For this reason,  we rely on an additional  data set, namely  the an- 
nual Socio-Economic  Panel ( SOEP, 2016 , v32). The SOEP is an ongoing  
panel survey with currently  about 30,000 survey participants  per year, 
conducted  since 1984 (see Wagner  et al., 2007 ). Similar  to the SES, the 
SOEP allows us to retrieve  individual  information  about employment,  
earnings  and working  time. However,  the SOEP has its own limitations  
since surveys  are typically  prone to measurement  issues. Participants  
may refuse answers  or misreport  income  or working  hours, which can 
potentially  lead to measurement  errors. Moreover,  the division  of the 
data into small-scale  areas results in small sample sizes, questioning  
the precision  of the regional  indicator.  We will therefore  ﬁrst evaluate  
whether  the SOEP is actually  suited to derive bite measures  on small- 
scale levels by comparing  them to the SES indicators.  Subsequently,  we 
can use it to evaluate  whether  wages have adapted  in anticipation  of the 
reform and how they changed  after its introduction.  Finding  no anticipa-  
tion and no contradiction  with the common  trend assumption  within the 
SOEP, we can make use of the more comprehensive  SES bite measures  
from April 2014 for our regression  analysis  of employment  dynamics.  
Hourly wages . We derive hourly wages in the SES by dividing  infor- 
mation about gross monthly  wages excluding  compensation  for overtime  
and surcharges  by monthly  paid hours without  overtime  for workers  
who are paid based on their working  hours. For all others, the income  is 
divided  by regular  weekly working  hours multiplied  by average  weeks 
per month.  As the SES does not provide  regional  information  of civil 
servants  at a smaller  level than federal states, the overall sample size re- 
duces to 780,000  observations.  Therefore,  mean wages could be under- 
estimated.  In order to prevent  outliers  in hourly wages from biasing  our 
results,  we winsorise  the data and set the ﬁrst and last percentile  of the 
overall hourly wage distribution  to the value of the corresponding  per-

and reports information  on regular employment  and mini-jobs  relation-  
ships, including  both employment  information  such as average monthly  pay- 
ments and individual  sociodemographic  information.  For further informa-

10 However,  note that the lack of representativeness  at the RLM level might 
lead to measurement  error and thus possibly  to attenuation  bias in our later 
analyses.  
11 In light of the minimum  wage introduction,  an additional,  voluntary  survey 
was conducted  in 2015 (‘Verdiensterhebung2015’).  However,  only 6,000 ﬁrms 
among the original sample participated.  The representative  character  of the SES 
2014 is therefore  at risk ( Destatis,  2017 ) and we refrain from using it for our 
analysis.

centiles.  We exclude  interns,  trainees,  and minors without  formal train- 
ing from the sample,  since they are exempted  from the minimum  wage. 
However,  since we cannot diﬀerentiate  between  agreements  above and 
below €8.50, we do not drop employees  with sectoral  bargaining  agree- 
ments. The SES provides  weights  for both ﬁrms and employees.  How- 
ever, they are constructed  to weight observations  at the level of federal 
states. Since we conduct  our estimations  at a smaller  regional  level, we 
refrain from weighting  our estimations.  Nonetheless,  we include  weights  
as a sensitivity  check in Section  5.2 . 
Similar  to the SES, hourly wages are not retrieved  directly  in the 
SOEP but can be computed  as the ratio of gross monthly  wages and 
weekly working  hours adjusted  by average  weeks per month.  As the 
SOEP not only includes  contractual  weekly working  hours but also the 
actual working  time –w h i c h  includes  paid and unpaid overtime  –w e 
derive the bite measures  for both concepts  and compare  them with each 
other. In principle,  using actual working  time is the more accurate  mea- 
sure as minimum  wages need to be paid for any working  time. However,  
the SOEP asks for weekly working  hours in general  and for income  for 
the previous  month.  Since both measures  thus do not necessarily  match 
each other, this possibly  leads to measurement  errors. Nonetheless,  since 
the contractual  wages are closer to the hours concept  of the SES, our 
analysis  focuses  on contractual  wages. Again, we restrict the SOEP sam- 
ple to eligible  employees  reporting  all necessary  wage information,  and 
apply a top and bottom  recoding  at the ﬁrst and last percentiles  to avoid 
measurement  errors. Moreover,  the sample is restricted  to individuals  
participating  after February,  since the income  question  refers to the pre- 
vious month and thus to the previous  year in case of January.  
Classiﬁcation  of regions . We use the two wage data sets to compute  
annual characteristics  of regional  wage distributions.  For this purpose,  
each individual  is assigned  to one region. Nonetheless,  the choice of 
the regional  level comes with a trade-oﬀ:  the smaller  the area classiﬁ-  
cation, the better that heterogeneous  labour market performances  and their variation  can be captured,  although  the more likely it is that the 
economic  structure  of a region is not picked up accurately,  e.g. in ar- 
eas with high commuter  ﬂows. In this sense, the sixteen federal states 
might be considered  too broad a classiﬁcation,  since there is a substan-  
tial amount  of heterogeneity  within each state. The 401 administrative  
districts  (‘Landkreise’)  account  for this dissimilitude  more accurately,  
although  they are also more prone to high commuter  ﬂows, which is 
why measures  like GDP per capita may not reﬂect the actual economic  
performance  of a district.  Moreover,  while the SOEP data provides  in- 
formation  on the place of residence,  the SES identiﬁes  the place of work 
of each respondent.  The classiﬁcation  should therefore  unite both con- 
cepts. 
A common  solution  to these problems  is using area classiﬁca-  
tions that account  for commuter  ﬂows and general  economic  perfor- 
mance.  In the following,  we rely on 141 RLMs deﬁned  by Kosfeld  and 
Werner  (2012) as they consider  commuter  ﬂows and regional  labour 
market seclusion.  Moreover,  they do not coincide  with the federal states, 
which is especially  expedient  for metropolitan  areas and city states. As 
an additional  sensitivity  check, in Section  5.2 we replicate  our estima-  
tion based on another  area classiﬁcation,  the 96 planning  regions  (‘Rau- 
mordnungsregionen’,  ROR). They divide Germany  into segregated  re- 
gions by commuter  ﬂows and economic  structure  and are deﬁned  by 
the federal states according  to their own regulations  (for details see 
BBSR, 2016 ). 
Since the SOEP sample is not uniformly  distributed  in Germany,  
some regions  have only few observations.  Thus, in addition  to the pre- 
vious restrictions  to the SOEP, we discard  regions  with fewer than 30 
observations  per year as they are strongly  dependent  on single individu-  
als and thus are relatively  volatile  in their bite measures.  For this reason,  
we omit 48 RLMs in the analysis  with the SOEP. After this restriction,  
we observe  89 individuals  on average  per region and year. When using 
the SES 2014, we rely on average  on 5,345 individuals  per RLM in 2014

with the smallest  (largest)  region containing  366 (46,202)  observations.  
Based on these regional  wage distributions,  we compute  the previously-  
introduced  Kaitz and Fraction  bite measures  for both data sets. 12 
Employment  data . Following  our theoretical  considerations,  hetero- 
geneous  wage eﬀects between  regions  can – depending  on the labour 
demand  elasticity  –cause  varying  adaptation  in employment.  This will 
be analysed  in our regression  analysis  in Section  5 . For this purpose,  
we combine  our regional  bite measures  with administrative  data on em- 
ployment  stocks. We examine  overall employment  deﬁned  as the sum of 
regular  and marginal  employment,  relying on administrative  informa-  
tion provided  by the FEA (2016) , where marginal  employment  includes  
jobs carried out as sole employment  as well as add-on mini-jobs.  Data 
on regular  employment  is available  from 2012 onwards  and information  
on mini-jobs  is at hand from 2013 onwards.  13 Since we only have the to- 
tal employment  head count, we cannot diﬀerentiate  between  sectors ex- 
empted  from the national  minimum  wage and non-exempted  industries.  
The labour market data is available  for administrative  districts  (‘Land- 
kreise’),  although  for the aforementioned  reasons  we aggregate  it to our 
RLM by summation.  Although  the data at hand is on a quarterly  basis, 
we will focus on annual eﬀects to abstract  from any seasonal  eﬀects. As 
a reference  point in time, we choose the second quarter  of each year 
(June 30th), as the points of the legislative  process  (parliament  election  
in September  2013, law passing  in July 2014, see Section  2 ) lie around 
that date. However,  we exploit the quarterly  data for the discussion  of 
underlying  dynamics  in Section  5.3 . 
In our regression  analysis,  we will make use of additional  control 
variables,  namely  the regional  population  level and GDP, taken from 
Destatis  (2016b)  . Like the outcome  variables,  they are only available  
for administrative  districts.  Hence, we also aggregate  them by addition.  
Note that the indicators  are measured  at the end of each respective  year. 
We impute the population  level for each quarter  by geometric  weighting  
and assume  a constant  ﬂow of migration  within a year. As the popula-  
tion, we employ  the working  age population  between  15 and 65 years. 
GDP per capita is manually  computed  as the GDP-population-ratio.  
4. Descriptive  results  
4.1. Bite variation  and correlations  
Regional  variation.  First, we evaluate  the geographical  structure  of the 
bite as its variation  is crucial for the identiﬁcation  strategy.  Only if areas 
are aﬀected  diﬀerently  can wage eﬀects and thus employment  eﬀects 
be identiﬁed  by the suggested  model. Fig. 2 presents  both Fraction  and 
Kaitz from the SES for the 141 RLMs. 14 
Both bite measures  reﬂect the long-lasting  and still signiﬁcant  struc- 
tural diﬀerences  between  East and West Germany,  since the bite is con- 
siderably  higher in the eastern  part. However,  there is not only a sub- 
stantial  variation  between  East and West, but also within.  Fig. 2 a shows 
that there are RLMs in the West that display  a high Fraction.  This holds 
true for some areas close to East Germany,  such as Göttingen  and Goslar. 
However,  regions  closer to the German  borders  –such as Cham to the 
12 Please note that the SOEP and SES hourly wage data slightly diﬀer. The SOEP 
only captures  the main occupation,  while SES also entails secondary  employ-  
ment. Moreover,  SOEP respondents  are registered  according  to the residence  
principle,  whereas  SES data is collected  in compliance  with the place of work 
principle.  This is especially  crucial for the regional  classiﬁcation  in our analysis.  
However,  we account for this by allowing  for commuter  ﬂows. For a summary  
of diﬀerences  between  the two data sets and a review of the consequential  com- 
putation  of hourly wages, see Dütsch et al. (2017) . 
13 The deﬁnition  of marginal  employment  changed  in 2013. Until 2012, em- 
ployment  was considered  a ‘mini-job’  up to a threshold  income of €400. The 
FEA does not provide coherent  information  concerning  marginal  employment  
for administrative  districts  before 2013. 
14 For reference,  a histogram  of the distributions  of Fraction  and Kaitz is pre- 
sented in Fig. A.1 (see Appendix).  east, the Volcanic  Eifel, Bitburg  and Cleves to the West and Emden 
and Wilhelmshaven  to the North –also display  a high Fraction.  On the 
other hand, cities and their surrounding  areas like Munich,  Düsseldorf  or 
Hanover,  as well as highly-industrialised  areas, such as east Lower Sax- 
ony or Rhine-Main  report a relatively  lower bite compared  with other 
parts of the corresponding  federal state. Moreover,  Fig. 2 b shows that 
the Kaitz and the Fraction  do not always yield the same ranking  of re- 
gions by bite. While the overall picture remains  roughly  the same, the 
Kaitz index displays  more variation  within Bavaria  than the Fraction.  
There are also some diﬀerences  for Baden–Württemberg  and Rhineland–
Palatinate.  This is due to the fact that the Kaitz index measures  the ratio 
between  the minimum  wage and the average  wage. It is therefore  not 
necessarily  aﬀected  in the same way as the fraction  of aﬀected  work- 
ers, since it only decreases  when the average  wage is in fact increased.  
Nonetheless,  it can also be inﬂuenced  by movements  in other parts of 
the wage distribution.  To get the full picture,  we will therefore  look at 
both measures  in our following  analysis.  Overall,  the graphical  analy- 
sis shows that we observe  considerable  regional  variation  in the bite 
indicators,  which can be used for the upcoming  analysis.  
Correlations  between  SES and SOEP . Before analysing  changes  in bite 
indicators,  we elaborate  on whether  the SOEP is suited to replicate  the 
SES measures,  despite its smaller  sample size per region. For this reason 
Table 2 displays  summary  statistics  for various  indicators  derived  from 
the SES and SOEP for 2014. As the SOEP oﬀers two wage concepts,  bite 
indicators  for contractual  wages (SOEP con ) and actual wages (SOEP act ) 
are listed. 
Table 2 shows that according  to the SES data on average  17.1% 
of eligible  workers  earned less than €8.50 in 2014. In the SOEP, 
this amounts  to 12.1 and 15.5%, respectively.  This is roughly  in 
line with the considerations  of the German  low-wage  commission  
( Mindestlohnkommission,  2016b ). The diﬀerences  in levels between  
both data sets arise because  the SES does not include  any public sector 
employees  at our regional  level. Since only 0.9% of them are aﬀected  
by the wage ﬂoor, excluding  them increases  the bite measures.  This is 
also the reason why the table does not replicate  the fractions  of aﬀected  
workers  from Table 1 . 
The lower panel of the table displays  the correlations  between  bite 
measures.  The correlations  between  indicators  from diﬀerent  data sets 
are considerably  high. The correlation  between  SES and SOEP Fraction  
is 0.657 or 0.7, respectively.  The Kaitz indices derived  from the SES and 
the SOEP display  a correlation  of at least 76%. Due to these large corre- 
spondences,  the identiﬁcation  of pre-treatment  indicators  with the SOEP 
is reasonable.  We can attest that regardless  of the known shortcomings  
of survey data, both SOEP and SES provide  similar bite measures.  
To relate our results to previous  studies and make an additional  
contribution  to the literature,  we calculate  one additional  bite mea- 
sure (Fraction  SES month ) based on the monthly  earnings  of full-time  
employed.  15 Since many data sources  lack information  on working  
hours, using monthly  wages of full-time  employees  only is common  
practice  (see Garloﬀ,  2016 ). However,  the validity  of this approach  is 
strongly  discussed.  By neglecting  the fact that especially  part-time  and 
marginally  employed  earned below the minimum  wage, the fraction  of 
aﬀected  workers  could be strongly  underestimated.  Table 2 shows that 
the monthly  bite for full-time  employees  amounts  on average  to only 
3.8%, which is substantially  lower than the bite based on hourly wages. 
This poses a problem  for general  statements  about the degree to which 
regions  were –or still are –aﬀected.  However,  assuming  that there are 
no systematical  diﬀerences  between  regions,  it is less crucial when the 
bite is used as a treatment  indicator.  Subsequently,  it should only re- 
ﬂect a relative  degree to which regions  are aﬀected,  irrespective  of its 
amount.  The Fraction  SES month displays  a very strong positive  correlation  
15 We follow Garloﬀ(2016)  and calculate  the fraction of workers  who earn less 
than €1,400 per month, are full-time  employed  and between  30 and 54 years 
old in proportion  to all full-time  employees  of that age category.

with the SES Fraction  derived  by hourly wages ( 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟 = 0 . 918 ). Accord-  
ingly, although  the monthly  bite is possibly  less precise,  both indicators  
measure  the same relative  treatment  intensity.  We will include  the mea- 
sure in our sensitivity  analysis  in Section  5.2 to test whether  it yields 
similar results when used as a treatment  indicator.  
4.2. Anticipation  and common  trend 
As already  discussed,  the SES does not allow evaluating  wages in 
years other than 2014. However,  this is possible  with the longitudinal  
SOEP data. For the analysis,  this is relevant  for two reasons:  ﬁrst, as 
proposed  by Eqs. (1a) and (1b) , we only expect diverging  changes  in 
employment  if wages adapt in light of the minimum  wage reform;  and 
second,  the diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences  framework  does not only imply a 
common  trend assumption  concerning  employment,  but also in wages, 
namely  that in the absence  of the policy reform,  wages and thus employ-  
ment would have developed  equally  in all areas. Hence, we will now 
graphically  examine  whether  we ﬁnd equal trends in the pre-treatment  
time frame. To do so, we sort all considered  regions  into one of three 
groups –l o w - , medium-  and high-bite  areas – according  to their bite 
level estimated  with the SOEP in 2014. We follow Card (1992) and set 
the cut points in the respective  bite such that each group comprises  the 
same number  of RLMs (see Table 2 for the corresponding  thresholds,  i.e. 
the 33rd and 67th percentile).  Fig. 3 a and b present  the average  level 
of Fraction  and the Kaitz-index  in high-, medium-,  and low-bite  areas 
between  2012 and 2015. 
In line with our deﬁnition,  Fraction  in high-bite  areas is signiﬁ- 
cantly higher compared  to the other regions  in all considered  years (see 
Fig. 3 a). While the share of employed  paid below €8.50 has been be- 
tween 6 and 12% in low- and medium-areas  between  2012 and 2014, 
we ﬁnd shares above 15% in high-bite  regions.  The same ordering  holds 
when we look at the Kaitz index (see Fig. 3 b). In the pre-treatment  years, 
Fraction  steadily  remained  large in high-bite  regions,  while it changed  
slightly  in low- and medium  bite regions.  However,  the diﬀerences  are 
not strong, showing  that trends have been roughly  similar across re- 
gions. Moreover,  Kaitz diminished  signiﬁcantly  in all areas between  
2013 and 2014. Accordingly,  high-, medium-  and low-bite  areas shared 
a joint trend in wages before the reform when loking at this indicator.  
These results suggest  that the common  trend assumption  for wages holds 
from this perspective,  even though there are some slight diﬀerences  in the trends of the Fraction  between  regions.  16 After the minimum  wage 
introduction,  however,  we see –as expected  –diverging  trends between  
regions.  According  to Fig. 3 a, Fraction  decreased  within medium-  and 
high-bite  areas by approximately  5 percentage  points, while staying  con- 
stant in low-bite  areas. This indicates  a positive  wage eﬀect in depen- 
dence of the regional  bite level. However,  the Fraction  did not decrease  
to zero after the reform,  seeing that the average  Fraction  in high-bite  
regions  amounted  to roughly  17.5% in 2014. The same pattern  holds 
for medium-  and low-bite  regions.  This is in line with the ﬁndings  of 
Caliendo  et al. (2017) and Burauel  et al. (2017) who stress that the 
adaptation  of wages –and thus Fraction  –had not been executed  com- 
pletely in early 2015. Accordingly,  regional  mean wages and therefore  
Kaitz seem almost unaﬀected  by the reform.  Here, bite levels changed  
only marginally  after 2014 and did not signiﬁcantly  diﬀer between  re- 
gional categories  (see Fig. 3 b). 
Since our estimation  strategy  also assumes  that employment  would 
have followed  the same trend in absence  of the reform,  we need to look 
at this dimension,  too. Regions  are assigned  into one of the three groups 
by their Fraction  obtained  from the SES, with the 33rd and 67th per- 
centile of the bite’s distribution  posing as a threshold.  Fig. 4 shows 
the average  logarithmic  levels for the three employment  types –t h a t 
will be used later on as outcome  variables  –i n the bite groups.  It can 
be seen that both overall and regular  log employment  are signiﬁcantly  
lower in high-bite  regions,  which is a cause of very diﬀerent  popula-  
tion levels across the region types. However,  Fig. 4 shows that the three 
bite groups share a common  trend over the years, implying  that the re- 
gions would have developed  equally  in absence  of the minimum  wage 
reform.  This holds true for the whole time horizon,  even after the wage 
ﬂoor introduction.  For marginal  employment,  diﬀerences  in levels be- 
tween regions  are even more pronounced.  17 Yet, the common  trend in 
employment  before the reform also holds for mini-jobs.  In contrast  to 
regular  employment,  though,  there appears  to be a slight decrease  in 
marginal  employment  between  2014 and 2015; potentially  a reaction  
16 We come to the same conclusion  when we look at mean annual changes  
in the bite. We ﬁnd no signiﬁcant  diﬀerences  in changes  in the bite between  
regions before the minimum  wage reform. The results are available  on request 
from the authors and in the Supplementary  Appendix.  
17 While the diﬀerent  levels of absolute  regular employment  between  high- and 
low-bite  areas can be explained  by diﬀerences  in population,  mini-jobs  are more 
frequent  in low-bite  regions even in relative terms. Evidence  on this is available  
on request from the authors and in the Supplementary  Appendix.

to the minimum  wage introduction.  However,  the post-treatment  ef- 
fects are not as apparent  in this illustration,  since Fig. 4 displays  ab- 
solute log employment  levels without  accounting  for the very diﬀerent  
population  levels. To provide  additional  evidence,  we thus consider  an 
alternative  approach,  where we look at conditional  correlations  between  
bite and employment  level, thereby  making  use of the continuity  of our 
bite indicator.  We do this by regressing  the log employment  level on 
the bite measure  interacted  with the year dummies  (and other control 
variables).  As presented  in Fig. A.2 in the Appendix,  the correspond-  
ing coeﬃcients  do not change much before the reform,  indicating  that 
the relationship  between  bite and employment  was stable in the pre- 
treatment  years. After the reform,  only marginal  employment  seems to 
be aﬀected.  When additionally  controlling  for time ﬁxed eﬀects and pop- 
ulation level (see Fig. A.2 b), the post-reform  change for marginal  em- 
ployment  becomes  even more pronounced,  while there is no diﬀerence  
before 2015. This analysis  thus supports  the common  trend assumption.  
Moreover,  it makes clear that the diverging  population  levels hamper  
the graphical  evaluation  of changes  in employment  levels. Population  is 
shown to be a crucial component  that we have to take into account  in 
our further analysis.  Fig. 4. Mean of logarithmic  employment  level within high-, mid-, and low-bite

5. Employment  eﬀects 
5.1. Main eﬀects 
After looking  at the employment  dynamics  descriptively,  we will 
now apply a ﬁxed-eﬀects  estimation  to evaluate  employment  eﬀects of 
the new minimum  wage in a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  framework.  We 
derived  our estimation  Eq. (3) in Section  3.2 : 
𝐸 𝑗,𝑡 = 𝛾𝑗 + 𝛾′𝑇 𝑡 + 𝜃′
1 𝑇 𝑡 ×𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑒 𝑗, 2014 + 𝛿1 𝐺𝐷𝑃 𝑗,𝑡 −1 + 𝛿2 𝑃 𝑂𝑃 𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜐𝑗,𝑡 , 
where E j, t denotes  the log employment  level and is measured  on 30th 
June in each year. 18 As discussed  above, we will estimate  the eﬀects on 
overall employment,  as well as for marginal  and regular  employment  
separately  in the following.  The treatment  eﬀect is identiﬁed  by the co- 
eﬃcients  of the interaction  term between  bite and year ( 𝜃1 ). We are 
especially  interested  in the coeﬃcient  of the interaction  term between  
the bite and the year 2015 (denoted  as Bite ×D2015 in the following  
tables),  which identiﬁes  the employment  change in the year of the min- 
imum wage introduction.  However,  to control for pre-treatment  trends 
and test the common  trend assumption,  we also include  pre-treatment  
years, such that our observation  period ranges from 2012 to 2015. For 
comparability  the reference  year remains  ﬁxed at 2014, such that the 
employment  eﬀects of the interaction  terms between  the bite and previ- 
ous years (Bite ×D2013 and Bite ×D2012,  respectively)  have to be in- 
terpreted  in relation  to the year 2014. Besides  the inclusion  of time- and 
region-ﬁxed  eﬀects 19 , we also control for regional  diﬀerences  in loga- 
rithmic  GDP in 𝑡 − 1 , assuming  that a region’s  economic  power will have 
an impact on its employment.  As employment  is additionally  strongly  
aﬀected  by the population  size (see also discussion  in Sections  3.2 and 
4.2 ), we also include  the logarithmic  population  size in t . 20 
Eﬀects on overall employment.  First, we focus on short-term  eﬀects on 
overall employment,  i.e. the sum of full-time,  part-time  and marginal  
employment.  Panel A in Table 3 presents  the corresponding  results.  
Columns  (1) to (4) use Fraction,  adding control variables  as well as 
pre-treatment  periods  iteratively.  Columns  (5) and (6) repeat the main 
speciﬁcations  for the Kaitz index. All speciﬁcations  use 2014 as the refer- 
ence year such that treatment  eﬀects in 2015 can be compared  between  
diﬀerent  speciﬁcations.  
Columns  (1) and (2) present  the employment  eﬀects from 2014 to 
2015 without  and with controls  for population  and GDP per capita. 
While GDP’s eﬀect is negligible,  controls  for current  population  dy- 
namics appear,  again, to be crucial.  Due to the direct interrelation  be- 
tween population  and the employment  level, the population  in t ex- 
plains a great share of within and between  variation  in employment.  
This holds major importance  for the upcoming  analysis.  Because  high- 
bite regions  have a smaller  population  and a diverging  population  trend 
(see Fig. A.3 in the Appendix),  variation  in employment  growth  due to 
diverging  changes  in population  will be attributed  to the minimum  wage 
when these diﬀerences  are not controlled  for. 21 
18 Including  not only one point in time per year but rather all quarters  yields 
similar results (and will be discussed  in Section 5.3 ). However,  variation  be- 
tween quarters  indicates  strong seasonal  dependency,  which can be ruled out 
easily by focusing  on annual changes  only. 
19 Using the change in employment  as dependent  and neglecting  regional  ﬁxed 
eﬀects yield the same results. The results are available  on request from the au- 
thors. 
20 We thus assume that the current population  level is not aﬀected  by the mini- 
mum wage. Although  this might not be the case –i.e. the population  in t is poten- 
tially endogenous  –we chose this speciﬁcation  over the population  in 𝑡 − 1 . This 
is because the population  changed  especially  in 2015, due to the large inﬂow 
of migrants,  which would not be captured  by the population  in 𝑡 − 1 . Moreover,  
since we only look at the ﬁrst six month after the reform, adaptations  in the 
current population  caused by the minimum  wage are not very likely. 
21 Additional  information  on trends of population  are available  on request from 
the authors and in the Supplementary  Appendix.  Since population  would have aﬀected  employment  in the absence  of 
the policy reform,  controlling  for the current  population  level is obliga- 
tory. By contrast,  diﬀerences  with respect to GDP seem to be controlled  
for by regional  ﬁxed eﬀects. 
Accordingly,  controlling  for population  eﬀects reduces  the highly 
signiﬁcant  treatment  eﬀect from -0.089 in Column  (1) to − 0.03 in Col- 
umn (2), which means that an increase  of Fraction  by one percentage  
point is associated  with a reduction  in employment  by 0.03% ceteris 
paribus.  Column  (3) additionally  includes  the year 2013. This allows 
us to revisit the common  trend assumption  and control for any pre- 
treatment  trends (common  to all regions),  giving us a more precise treat- 
ment eﬀect. This more extensive  estimation  will serve as our preferred  
speciﬁcation.  While the eﬀect diminishes  slightly  to − 0.025, it remains  
highly signiﬁcant.  Moreover,  the pre-treatment  interaction  term (Bite 
×D2013)  does not display  a signiﬁcant  coeﬃcient  supporting  our con- 
clusions  from the descriptive  analysis  in Section  4 that the regions  fol- 
lowed the same trend before the reform.  Repeating  the speciﬁcations  
from Column  (2) and (3) with the Kaitz index in Columns  (5) and (6) 
yields similar eﬀects. We thus conclude  that there was indeed a negative  
eﬀect on overall employment  in dependence  of the minimum  wage bite 
and will now further explore  what drives these eﬀects. 
Revisiting  our discussion  from Section  2 , where we argued that es- 
pecially  mini-jobs  are of special interest  for the wage ﬂoor evaluation,  
we will now investigate  in a second step, whether  employment  eﬀects 
are indeed largest for this group. To do so, we analyse  the eﬀects for 
marginal  employment  and regular  employment  separately.  
Eﬀects on marginal  employment  . Panel B of Table 3 sheds light on 
changes  in mini-jobs.  As discussed  above, this type of employment  with 
monthly  earnings  of up to €450 is of speciﬁc  interest  as it is character-  
ized by low gross hourly wages and small employee  sided social security  
contributions.  We follow the same structure  as in Panel A. All columns  of 
Panel B show that high-bite  regions  report a highly signiﬁcant  reduction  
in mini-jobs  after the introduction  of the minimum  wage. Comparing  
Columns  (1) and (2) shows that –v e r y similar to overall employment  
–population  size has a large impact on marginal  employment  through-  
out all speciﬁcations,  while a region’s  GDP does not have a signiﬁcant  
eﬀect. Following  Column  (2) in Panel B, an increase  in Fraction  by one 
percentage  point is associated  with a reduction  in marginal  employment  
by 0.17%. Column  (3)–which  includes  the year 2013 and the placebo  
test –y i e l d s  a similar treatment  eﬀect of 0.177. However,  since Col- 
umn (3) of Panel B in Table 3 identiﬁes  a slight decrease  in mini-jobs  
already  from 2013 to 2014, we need to be cautious  with the interpre-  
tation. With the reference  year 2014, a one percentage  point increase  
in Fraction  translates  to 0.05% more mini-jobs  in 2013, pointing  to the 
fact that mini-jobs  already  declined  in highly-aﬀected  regions  even be- 
fore the minimum  wage introduction.  However,  its magnitude  is not as 
large as the eﬀect from 2014 to 2015, which indicates  that the addi- 
tional reduction  is likely due to the reform.  Moreover,  using the Kaitz 
index yields similar treatment  eﬀects without  showing  any anticipation,  
suggesting  that the results are robust. 
Eﬀects on regular employment  . The estimation  results for regular  em- 
ployment  are reported  in Panel C of Table 3 . The overall picture is con- 
sistent with the previous  results.  Since regular  employment  makes up a 
large share of overall employment,  the coeﬃcients  are closer to Panel A. 
However,  the signiﬁcance  is not as prevalent  as in Panels A and B, indi- 
cating that the main driver for the reduction  in overall employment  was 
the reduction  in mini-jobs  rather than a decline  in full- and part-time  
employment.  Column  (2) implies  a treatment  eﬀect of 0.017, meaning  
an increase  in Fraction  by one percentage  point is associated  with a re- 
duction  in regular  employment  by 0.017%.  As in the previous  Panels, 
Column  (3) appends  the estimation  by the year 2013. Since for regular  
employment  we also have data for 2012, we additionally  include  Col- 
umn (4) which even stretches  the time horizon  to 2012 and serves as our 
preferred  speciﬁcation  for regular  employment.  The eﬀect diminishes  to 
-0.012 and is insigniﬁcant  in Column  (3) and close to being insigniﬁcant  
in Column  (4), meaning  that the minimum  wage aﬀected  regular  em-

insigniﬁcant,  conﬁrming  the common  trend assumption.  Repeating  the 
speciﬁcations  from Column  (2) and (4) with the Kaitz-index  in Columns

Aggregated  employment  eﬀects . In order to provide  a benchmark  for 
the absolute  nationwide  impact of the minimum  wage we will now trans- 
late the estimated  treatment  eﬀects into aggregated  eﬀects. In the fol- 
lowing,  we use our results from Table 3 and predict the relative  and 
absolute  employment  eﬀect for the German  labour market.  For this pre- 
diction,  we multiply  our estimated  treatment  eﬀects with the regional  
bite level. We assume  that Fraction  aﬀects employment  from zero on- wards, i.e. a Fraction  of zero is the counterfactual  scenario.  Since Kaitz 
has no such explicit  level where a strictly positive  minimum  wage has 
no causal eﬀect 22 , we focus on Fraction  here. After estimating  relative  
employment  eﬀects, we put them in relation  to the employment  level in 
2014 to compute  absolute  eﬀects. Table 4 summarizes  the predictions  
for all three employment  categories  and all main speciﬁcations  using 
22 This is because the denominator,  the mean regional  wage, is a ﬁrst raw 
moment  of the wage distribution  that provides  little information  on the ‘bite’ in 
the absence of information  on higher-moments.

Fraction  from above. The columns  are numbered  as in Table 3 and also 
include  the corresponding  coeﬃcients.  
On average,  the minimum  wage led to a relative  reduction  in over- 
all employment  from − 0.42 to − 0.52%. This amounts  to a head count 
of 137,000  to 165,000  jobs less due to the wage ﬂoor. These estima-  
tions roughly  correspond  with Bossler and Gerner (2016) , who estimate  
a negative  eﬀect of overall 78,000 jobs. For marginal  employment,  we 
compute  an average  relative  employment  eﬀect of almost 3% translating  
to roughly  189,000  jobs. In comparison,  vom Berge et al. (2016b)  report 
a reduction  of 94,000 mini-jobs  between  December  2014 and January  
2015 in addition  to any seasonal  trends. We thus ﬁnd an even larger 
negative  eﬀect on marginal  employment  from summer  2014 to 2015 
than previous  studies (see also Garloﬀ,  2016 ). Looking  at regular  em- 
ployment,  we ﬁnd no or, at most, weak negative  eﬀects of about 52,000 
in our preferred  speciﬁcation  which is to say that the estimation  does 
not imply strong eﬀects after the minimum  wage introduction  on this di- 
mension.  However,  since we assume  a counterfactual  scenario  where the 
bite is zero and our baseline  estimation  for marginal  employment  ques- 
tions the common  trend assumption,  the reduction  of 189,000  should 
be interpreted  with caution  and considered  as an upper bound. 
Moreover,  the fact that the estimated  absolute  eﬀects of marginal  
and regular  employment  do not add up to overall employment  has sev- 
eral reasons.  First and foremost,  marginal  employment  is not distributed  
evenly across the country  (see again Fig. 4 ). The neglected  heterogene-  
ity between  regional  labor markets  may thus bias the treatment  eﬀect 
for overall employment.  Moreover,  the treatment  eﬀect of regular  em- 
ployment  has a considerable  standard  error, which also manifest  itself in 
a wide conﬁdence  interval  of the presented  aggregated  eﬀects. The dif- 
ference  may thus not be statistically  signiﬁcant.  Finally,  we see a slight 
signiﬁcant  decrease  of marginal  employment  already  before the intro- 
duction  of the wage ﬂoor, which could cause an overestimation  of the 
eﬀects if it is a general  trend in marginal  employment.  Consequentially,  
the combination  of these issues could cause a divergence  between  the 
overall and the separate  eﬀects. Nevertheless,  the results show that there 
was a reduction  in overall employment  in the short run. 
5.2. Robustness  analysis  
Thus far, we have found strong eﬀects of the minimum  wage on over- 
all employment,  mainly driven by mini-jobs,  while regular  employment  
has only been slightly  aﬀected.  We will now test the robustness  of our 
results in diﬀerent  directions,  i.e. we employ  another  area classiﬁcation,  
a weighted  SES bite measure,  the SES bite based on monthly  wages, a 
bite measure  constructed  with the SOEP and two binary indicators.  The 
results of the robustness  tests are summarized  in Table 5 . The follow- ing tables use the Fraction  indicator  and include  all pre-treatment  years, 
since this is the most comprehensive  speciﬁcation.  
Area classiﬁcation  . As discussed  in Section  3.3 , we apply another  area 
classiﬁcation  to test the extent to which our results are dependent  on the 
chosen deﬁnition  of regions.  Therefore,  we re-estimate  the eﬀects based 
on the 96 planning  regions.  The results are displayed  in Column  (2) of 
Table 5 . For reference,  our baseline  estimation  from above is presented  
in Column  (1). Both the magnitude  and the signiﬁcance  of the eﬀects are 
very similar to the results obtained  using the RLMs, thus substantiating  
our ﬁndings.  
Weighting  of the SES bite measure  . The SES provides  weights  for ﬁrms 
and employees.  However,  they are constructed  to be representative  at 
the level of federal states. Since we use a smaller  area classiﬁcation,  
we have used unweighted  data thus far. Nonetheless,  since this decision  
is arbitrary,  we conduct  a sensitivity  test by including  weighted  data. 
Column  (3) of Table 5 provides  the corresponding  results.  Once again, 
the results are very similar to our baseline  results in terms of magnitude  
and signiﬁcance.  
Bite measure  based on monthly  earnings  . As discussed  in Section  4 , pre- 
vious studies use information  on monthly  earnings  only, thus relying on 
critical assumptions  on working  hours (see e.g. Garloﬀ,  2016 ). We can 
review this alternative  approach  with our data and rely on a bite based 
on the share of full-time  employed  earning  less than €1,400 per month.  
Column  (4) of Table 5 displays  a highly signiﬁcant  coeﬃcient  of -0.042 
for regular  employment  in Panel B. While this eﬀect is much higher in 
magnitude  than our baseline  result, it has to be evaluated  in relation  
to the average  Fraction.  Given the lower level in the monthly  Fraction  
(on average  3.8%, see Table 2 ), this translates  into an average  employ-  
ment eﬀect of − 0.16% and thus an employment  loss of only 37,000 jobs. 
While this is close to our baseline  estimation,  diﬀerences  with respect 
to marginal  employment  are higher. Here, the estimation  in Column  (4) 
shows a coeﬃcient  of − 0.34, which means an average  treatment  eﬀect 
of − 1.27% and thus a reduction  in marginal  employment  of 67,000 only. 
While this is exactly the eﬀect obtained  by Garloﬀ (2016)  , it amounts  
to only one third of our previously-derived  results.  As discussed  above, 
relying on monthly  income  of full-time  employees  only might bias the 
results.  The diﬀerence  could thus be explained  by the lack of informa-  
tion on part-time  employed  and mini-jobbers  within the computation  of 
the bite, which appears  to be crucial for the estimation  of corresponding  
employment  eﬀects. 
Bite measure  based on SOEP . Thus far, we have used SOEP data only 
to evaluate  changes  in bite over time, while we refrained  from using it 
in our analysis  of employment  eﬀects since it contains  only little data 
for some RLMs and is somewhat  prone to measurement  error. However,  
we will employ  the bite derived  from contractual  hours as an alternative  
data source for the employment  eﬀects estimation  as a sensitivity  test. 
The corresponding  results are presented  in Column  (5) of Table 5 . RLMs 
with fewer than 30 observation  in the SOEP are not considered  in the 
estimation,  which is why the number  of observations  decreases  quite 
drastically.  The estimated  treatment  eﬀects for overall employment  and 
marginal  employment  remain signiﬁcant  but are considerably  smaller  
in comparison  to our baseline  estimation  (e.g. the treatment  eﬀect on 
marginal  employment  is now − 1.3% compared  to − 2.97% in the base- 
line estimation).  The eﬀects on regular  employment,  on the other hand, 
are not signiﬁcantly  diﬀerent  from zero and there are weakly signiﬁcant  
negative  eﬀects even before the introduction,  implying  that the common  
trend assumption  does not hold. These diﬀerences  could be due to the 
fact that the dropped  48 RLMs are foremost  those with a low popula-  
tion density,  typically  also being areas with relative  high bite levels. 
Clearly,  this loss in information  makes the estimation  less precise and is 
not desirable  in our situation.  
Binary treatment  indicator  . The lack of representativeness  at the RLM 
level within the SES might cause a measurement  error on the bite level, 
which could bias our estimates  if the error correlates  with bite or the 
outcome  variable.  To test the robustness  regarding  errors at the bite 
level, we additionally  derive two binary treatment  indicators,  sorting

Fraction  is used as continuous  bite measure  in all speciﬁcations  except Columns  (6) and (7), where it is binary. Reference  year in all speciﬁcations  2014. Controls,  
regional  and time ﬁxed eﬀects are included.  Controls  are GDP in 𝑡 − 1 and Population  in t . Speciﬁcation  (1) is the baseline  estimation,  (2) applies the regional

regions  into treatment  and control groups based on the Fraction’s  dis- 
tribution.  Accordingly,  the exact level is not decisive  for the estimation,  
but rather the distinction  between  low- and high-wage  regions  only. In 
Column  (6), regions  in the highest  quarter  of the distribution  are con- 
sidered  treated and the lowest quarter  are sorted into the control group. 
Regions  in between  are discarded.  23 Column  (7) alters the cut-oﬀto  the 
median,  such that no RLMs are dropped.  Using binary indicators  yields 
similar results compared  to our baseline  estimation.  Column  (6) identi- 
ﬁes a signiﬁcant  eﬀect for regular  employment.  This means that regions  
in the highest  quarter  of the bite distribution  had a signiﬁcant  reduc- 
tion of 0.4% in regular  employment  compared  to regions  in the lowest 
quarter.  As for mini-jobs,  the results are again highly signiﬁcant.  Col- 
umn (6) yields a treatment  eﬀect of 3%, which is nearly the eﬀect of 
our baseline  estimation.  The softening  of the treatment  assignment  in 
Column  (7) diminishes  the average  treatment  eﬀect for both employ-  
ment types. Given the less disjunctive  deﬁnition,  this is to be expected  
and the results substantiate  our baseline  estimations.  24 
Employment-to-population  ratio . As discussed  in Section  3.2 , we in- 
clude the employment  level in logarithmic  terms as the dependent  vari- 
able in our baseline  estimation.  We thus decide not to employ  the widely 
used employment-to-population  ratio on the right hand side, since it 
makes it diﬃcult  to disentangle  the eﬀects of employment  and popula-  
tion. To test the sensitivity  of this approach,  we display  the results of 
a regression  of the ratio in Column  (8) of Table 5 . The coeﬃcients  and 
23 This leaves us with 36 RLMs in each group. What needs to be kept in mind 
with this separation  is, that 32 of the high-bite  regions in the treatment  group 
are in East Germany,  whereas  all of the low-bite  regions are in West Germany.  
24 Using a binary speciﬁcation  that divides the treatment  and control group at 
p33/p66  as well as constructing  binary indicators  with the Kaitz yield essentially  
the same results. The results are available  on request from the authors.  signiﬁcances  are very close to our baseline  results,  leading  to slightly  
smaller  predictions  of absolute  job losses. 
5.3. Potential  channels  and dynamics  
So far we have shown that particularly  marginal  employment  de- 
creased  in course of the wage ﬂoor reform.  However,  it is possible  that 
marginal  employment  was transitioned  to part-time  employment  (see 
Section  2 ). Unfortunately,  with our aggregate  data we cannot disen- 
tangle whether  mini-jobs  were mainly lost or transformed  into regular  
part-time  employment.  We will thus try to shed some further light on 
potential  channels  and dynamics  behind these eﬀects. 
Examining  sole and add-on mini-jobs  . One way to examine  the under- 
lying mechanisms  is to look at add-on and sole marginal  employment  
separately.  As discussed  in Section  2 , add-on mini-jobbers  might not be 
as willing to transition  to part-time  as exclusively  marginally  employed.  
We would therefore  expect a stronger  reaction  for contract  adaptations  
in sole than in add-on mini-jobs,  whereas  unemployment  should aﬀect 
both groups similarly.  25 When we re-run the model with the level of add- 
on and sole mini-jobs  separately  (see Table A.1 ), we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant,  
negative  treatment  eﬀect for sole mini-jobs  only, whereas  the number  
of add-on mini-jobs  is not aﬀected.  With respect to the considerations  
from above, the eﬀect being only driven by sole mini-jobbers  is an indi- 
cation that the employment  eﬀect was mainly caused by transitions  to 
part-time  rather than to unemployment.  
Seasonal  patterns  and quarterly  analysis  . Furthermore,  we exploit the 
more detailed  seasonal  data on employment  and evaluate  when the dis- 
cussed eﬀects took place by estimating  quarterly  treatment  eﬀects (see 
25 We cannot rule out potential  diﬀerences  between  sole and add-on mini- 
jobbers,  though, which can also explain these diﬀerences.  If the latter are, for 
instance,  more productive,  job losses could be less likely for them.

Fig. A.4 ). We ﬁnd that regular  employment  was negatively  aﬀected  by 
the Fraction  in summer  and autumn  after the minimum  wage was in- 
troduced.  Yet, at the end of the fourth quarter  of 2015 no diﬀerence  to 
the previous  years can be identiﬁed.  Eﬀects on regular  employment  may 
thus especially  occur in summer,  aﬀecting  seasonal  or short-term  hiring 
only. While marginal  employment  displays  a seasonal  dependence,  too, 
the eﬀect of the minimum  wage occurred  right after the introduction  
in the ﬁrst quarter  of 2015. After that, no strong further eﬀects can be 
identiﬁed,  implying  that the reduction  was mainly taking place imme- 
diately.  In connection  with vom Berge et al. (2016b)  who report that 
part-time  transitions  were the main reason for a reduction  in marginal  
employment  in January  2015, this could also hint at the fact that mini- 
jobs decreased  due to contract  adaptations  (which is easily done from an 
administrative  point of view) rather than due to a change to unemploy-  
ment. However,  Fig. A.4 b also shows that a small reduction  took place 
even in the months  before the wage ﬂoor reform.  Overall,  our ﬁndings  
hint at the fact that a substantial  share of mini-jobs  was transformed  
rather than lost. 
Non-compliance  . While transforming  marginal  into regular  employ-  
ment is one adjustment  channel  for employers,  another  often dis- 
cussed (illegal)  alternative  is simple non-compliance.  As descriptively  
discussed  in Section  4 , the fraction  of aﬀected  workers  decreased  
after the minimum  wage introduction.  This is also supported  by 
Caliendo  et al. (2017) who ﬁnd a positive  eﬀect on wages at the bottom  
of the wage distribution.  However,  it is also seen that the fraction  did 
not decrease  to zero in 2015, indicating  that the wage ﬂoor was not fully 
enforced.  Looking  at contractual  wages, Burauel  et al. (2017) show that 
still eight percent  of the eligible  employees  were paid less than €8.50 
per hour, translating  into roughly  2 million  workers.  These high levels 
of possible  non-compliance  could thus also explain  why the short-term  
employment  eﬀects we ﬁnd were not as strong as anticipated.  
6. Conclusions  
The introduction  of the minimum  wage in Germany  was preceded  by 
many –predominantly  negative  –expectations  for the development  of 
employment.  In worst-case  scenarios,  a loss of 500,000  to 900,000  jobs 
was predicted  for the long-run  ( Knabe et al., 2014; Müller and Steiner,  
2013 ). The evaluation  of the eﬀects of the minimum  wage, however,  
is complicated  by the universality  of the policy, which reduces  the set 
of potential  identiﬁcation  strategies.  The application  of the minimum  
wage on almost any employee  in every region does not allow for the 
use of the law for a quasi-experimental  setting.  For this reason,  our 
analysis  relies on regional  diﬀerences  in wage levels as a source of vari- 
ation, as proposed  by Card (1992) . The approach  exploits  the assump-  
tions that the higher the impact of the minimum  wage on the regional  
wage distribution,  the more strongly  that the regional  labour market is 
aﬀected.  
Therefore,  we identify  two commonly-used  regional  bite measures  
–t h e Fraction  and the Kaitz index – which  give us a broader  picture 
of the degree to which regions  are aﬀected  by the minimum  wage re- 
form. Using 141 RLMs, we are able to account  for regional  dependen-  
cies in economic  performance  and commuter  ﬂows. To assure a valid 
assessment  of the minimum  wage eﬀects, we combine  diﬀerent  data 
sets. Our main data source is the SES 2014, which entails comprehen-  
sive wage data from the year prior to the reform.  However,  since it is 
only available  every four years, we extend our analysis  by adopting  the 
longitudinal  Socio-Economic  Panel (SOEP),  allowing  to test our assump-  
tions about anticipation  in more pre-treatment  periods.  When examin-  
ing the bite measures  obtained  by diﬀerent  concepts  and diﬀerent  data 
sources  more closely,  we establish  strong correlations  between  these 
concepts,  thus declaring  their application  valid. This is substantiated  by 
our estimation  results,  which do not yield considerably  diﬀerent  results.  
Despite  certainly  being less precise,  we can even validate  the employ-  
ment of the treatment  intensity  constructed  with the monthly  earnings  of full-time  employees  only, if hourly wage data is not available  in future 
research.  
We use the SOEP to analyse  potential  anticipation  eﬀects in wages 
and show that overall there were no relevant  anticipation  eﬀects be- 
fore the introduction  of the reform,  such that we can assume  that re- 
gional wages would have followed  the same trend in the absence  of the 
minimum  wage. In summary,  we ﬁnd a signiﬁcant  negative  eﬀect of 
the minimum  wage on total employment.  Following  our baseline  esti- 
mation,  overall employment  reduced  by 0.025%  per percentage  point 
increase  in Fraction  due to the minimum  wage, which we predict to be 
roughly  140,000  jobs and approximately  0.4% of total employment.  Our 
results are mainly driven by a reduction  in marginal  employment.  In ac- 
cordance  with descriptive  studies (e.g. vom Berge et al., 2016b ) we ﬁnd 
indications  that at least parts of the losses in marginal  employment  could 
have been transferred  into regular  employment.  But, while the eﬀects on 
mini-jobs  are considerably  robust across speciﬁcations,  estimations  on 
regular  employment  do not allow for a clear conclusion.  Here, we ﬁnd 
no or, at most, weak negative  eﬀects of the minimum  wage. However,  
transitions  from mini-jobs  to regular  employment  could have covered  
an underlying  decrease  of full- and part-time  jobs triggered  by the re- 
form. Unfortunately,  we cannot disentangle  these eﬀects since the data 
does not allow to follow individual  employment  spells. However,  such 
transitions  should not aﬀect overall employment.  Because  overall em- 
ployment  decreased,  we thus conclude  that the policy reform aﬀected  
labor demand  negatively  in the short-run.  Yet, one limitation  with our 
study is, that the SES data only ensures  representativeness  at the level 
of federal states. Thus, we induce possible  measurement  error by disag- 
gregating  to RLMs, which could bias our results towards  zero. However,  
we address  this issue by using weighted  data as well as testing a binary 
indicator  in our robustness  analysis  and the results do not hint at any 
major problems.  
Although  our results lie above the eﬀects found in previous  studies,  
they are still well below the predictions  of 500,000  to 900,000  job losses. 
One possible  explanation  for this is that we only identify  short-term  ef- 
fects, while the eﬀects predicted  in ex-ante  studies are catered  to the 
long run. However,  job losses could have also failed to appear because  
other channels  of adjustment  were chosen.  Correspondingly,  employer  
surveys  show that alternatives  to displacements  such as the reduction  
in working  hours or an increase  in prices, have been preferred  to date 
( Bellmann  et al., 2016; Mindestlohnkommission,  2016b; Sauer and Wo- 
jciechowski,  2016 ). An additional  explanation  could be the existence  of 
a monopsony,  where the current  minimum  wage lies below the marginal  
product  of labour, in which case theory would not predict any job losses. 
Moreover,  while in a companion  paper (see Caliendo  et al., 2017 ), we 
show that wages did in fact increase  for employees  at the bottom  of the 
wage distribution,  there is strong evidence  that wages had not adapted  
fully in 2015, and about 8% of the eligible  population  were still earn- 
ing less than the minimum  wage per hour shortly after the introduction  
( Burauel  et al., 2017 ). This points to a generally-postponed  adjustment,  
in which case labour demand  would not have fully adjusted  in 2015 ei- 
ther. The near absence  of an eﬀect on regular  employment  could then 
also be explained  by non-compliance.  In this case, it might be too early 
to derive policy conclusions.  However,  the reduction  in the number  of 
marginally  employed  –w h i c h  was the most aﬀected  group with rela- 
tively easy adjustment  possibilities  –might  serve as a precursor  for more 
severe eﬀects on regular  employment  in the long run once labour de- 
mand has fully adjusted  and the minimum  wage is fully enforced.  Thus, 
the eﬀects of the minimum  wage will have to be re-evaluated  when suf- 
ﬁcient long-term  information  is available.  Moreover,  the adaptation  of 
the wage ﬂoor from €8.50 to €8.84 introduces  new movement  and a 
possible  route for further evaluations.

This article investigates a puzzle in the literature on labour markets in
developing countries: labour legislations not only have an impact on the
formal labour market but also an impact on the informal sector. It has
even been argued that the impact on the informal sector in the case of theminimum wage is stronger than on the formal sector. Usingquasi-experiments of minimum wage changes and thereby exploiting
geographical variation of the minimum wage bite, I find evidence for this
hypothesis. Informal workers, workers without social security contribu-tion, experienced significant wage increases when the minimum wage wasraised while formal workers did not. This result highlights that
noncompliance with one labour legislation, the social security
contribution, does not necessarily imply noncompliance to other labourlaws such as the minimum wage.

I. Introduction
‘In some countries, the minimum wage is more
effective among those who are regarded as informal
workers than in other segments of the labourmarkets’.
1
Minimum wages and the evaluation of their impact
on the labour market have been central in the
empirical literature for many years (Card andKrueger, 1995). Recently, the focus has shifted
towards the minimum wage in developing countriesand their heterogeneous labour markets. Here, thehypothesis has been put forward that labour market
regulations, the minimum wage being one of them,
directed at the formal labour market affect theinformal labour market (Harrison and Leamer,1997). This was also highlighted by the above quote,
which proposes an even stronger hypothesis: labour

market regulations directed at the formal labour
market affect the informal labour market more than
the formal labour market. Empirical evidence on this
is very sparse in the literature and a need for further
research in the area of labour market policies and
regulations for several Latin American countries,
including Argentina, was emphasized in the literature(Heckman and Pages, 2003; IADB, 2004; Lemos,
2009).
This article contributes to an emerging literature in
assessing the impact of the minimum wage on the
formal and informal sector wages. This analysis
challenges the traditional view of the informallabour market as a sector which is segmented and
no labour regulations directly apply to, often referred
to as the Harris–Todaro view of informality–formal-ity (Harris and Todaro, 1970).
2In this view of the
informal labour market, minimum wage increases
would only directly impact wages in the formal sector
and have an indirect effect on the informal labour
market. Increases of formal wages, after the intro-duction of minimum wage increases, would lead to
some workers being crowded out of the formal sector.
These workers would then go on to find jobs in theinformal sector, thereby driving wages down in the
informal sector. If this was the case, empirically, we
would expect to find wage dispersion between formal
and informal wages. However, Lemos (2009) shows
that for Brazil this is not the case. She finds a wagecompression effect for both sectors in her study using
panel data techniques.
The novelty of this current article is to exploit two
quasi-experiments of minimum wage changes and to
apply a difference-in-difference estimation using the
differential bite of the minimum wage in an area’swage distribution from the US and UK minimum
wage literature, using cross-section data in a devel-
oping country with increasing informality in thelabour market (Card, 1992a; Card and Krueger,
1995; Stewart, 2002).
Employing difference-in-difference estimation and
kernel densities from the developed country minimum
wages literature, this article investigates the impact of
minimum wage increases on the formal and informallabour market of a developing country. In addition to
previous work in this area, it is of interest to see
whether the impact provides evidence for the
hypothesis that the minimum wage is more applicable
in the informal segment of the labour market than theformal segment. This article finds support for this
hypothesis when looking at two minimum wage
changes, 1993 and 2004, in Argentina, a countrywith a large degree of labour informality.A significant wage increase was found for the overall
and the informal wage distribution after minimum
wage changes while this was not the case for theformal wage distribution. This implies a potential role
for the minimum wage as a reference wage or fair
wage for the informal sector (Marshall, 2004), whichdoes not receive other benefits such as social security.
In the next section some of the most related
literature and previous findings are presented.
Thereafter background on minimum wages andinformality in Argentina and available data are
discussed. In the fourth section I describe my empir-
ical strategy and obtained results, with tests for theapplicability of the empirical strategy and a robust-
ness check. In the conclusion the contribution and
implications of these results for policy are considered.
II. Minimum Wages and the Informal
Sector
Minimum wage policies are not only a common labour
market feature in developed countries, but also in
many developing countries in Latin America, Africa,the Middle East and Asia (Mazumdar, 1989). This
section briefly reviews some theoretical considerations
of the impact of minimum wage policies on the formaland informal labour market in developing countries.
In addition to that the most relevant existing empirical
evidence for developing countries is presented.
Theory
Theoretical considerations on the impact of the
minimum wage depend on the view of the labour
market and its dynamics in developing countries,where the informal labour market coexists alongside
the formal segment of the labour market. Government
interventions potentially have differential impacts onthe formal and informal labour market.
In the traditional dualistic labour markets the view
prevails that these two labour markets, formal and
informal, are segmented by nominal wage rigiditiessuch as the minimum wage (Harris and Todaro, 1970;
Mazumdar, 1989). Following the two-sector model of
the labour market of Mazumdar (1989), one canobserve competitive market wages and full employ-
ment before the introduction of the minimum wage in
covered (formal) and uncovered (informal) sector.
After the introduction of the minimum wage, which
increases the formal sector wage, some workersbecome unemployed in the formal labour market.
Some of these workers might decide to remain

unemployed and wait for a job in the formal sector.
Other displaced workers might seek employment inthe informal sector. This would increase the labour
supply in the informal labour market and thereby
driving down the informal sector wage. The informallabour market would clear at a wage level below thecompetitive wage.
The minimum wage impact here would result in an
increase in formal wages and a decrease in informal
wages. In terms of employment the effects are theopposite: a decrease in employment in the formal
sector and an increase in employment in the informal
sector (Harrison and Leamer, 1997). The magnitudesof these effects crucially depend on minimum wageeffectiveness on wages and on the labour demand
elasticity (Mazumdar, 1989).
These, tough, are not the only potential impacts of
the minimum wage on wages and employment in theformal and informal sector. Three possible channelsshow that the minimum wage might potentially
increase informal wages which are identified in the
literature (Bird and Manning, 2002):
(1) Minimum wages due their redistributive nature
can increase income not only in the formal
sector but also in the informal sector (Carruthand Oswald, 1981; Lustig and McLeod, 1997;Saget, 2001). For instance, in this framework
the formal sector wage increase due to the
minimum wage could lead to capital realloca-tion into the labour-intensive informal sector,which in turn would raise informal sector
wages (Harrison and Leamer, 1997).
(2) The minimum wage has a positive impact on
informal wages through linkages of the labourand goods market (Fizsbein, 1992). The
assumption of a high employment share of the
informal sector and formal sector workers asmain buyers of the informal sector products iscrucial for this result and highly dependent on
the particular elasticities of the demand and
supply effect of the minimum wage (Bird andManning, 2002). An increase in formal sectorwages would increase the demand for goods and
services produced in the informal sector, which
leads to an increase in informal sector wages.Also this model assumes a relatively homoge-neous informal labour market, which has been
contested in the literature (Fields, 1990).
(3) The minimum wage is used as a ‘benchmark’
for what is considered fair remuneration in thelabour market. The minimum wage is
employed as numeraire and thereby wagesand benefits are quoted in multiples of theminimum wage (Maloney and Nunez, 2004).
These three channels are put forward by the literature
as potential explanations for the so-called lighthouse
effect of the minimum wage on the informal wage
distribution, which is tested in recent empiricalliterature for developing countries.
Empirical evidence in developing countries
The empirical literature on the minimum wage impact
for developing countries is still relatively small, but
growing, and lacks empirical evidence for manydeveloping countries (Lemos, 2009). For Brazil andIndonesia the empirical literature on the minimumwage impacts is more exhaustive than for other
developing countries, which is shortly reviewed here.
Thereafter a summary of the previous sparse empir-ical research on Argentina is also described.
In the Brazilian studies of the minimum wage
authors generally find that the minimum wage
compressed the wage distribution for formal and
informal labour market (Amadeo et al ., 2000;
Carneiro, 2000; Neri et al ., 2000; Corseuil and
Carneiro, 2001; Corseuil and Morgado, 2001;Fajnzylber, 2001; Lemos, 2004a, b, 2009; Maloney
and Nunez, 2004).
3On the employment effects some
mixed results are obtained tough. On one handstudies suggested a small negative employment effectin both sectors (Fajnzylber, 2001; Lemos, 2004b); onthe other hand other studies suggest a negative
employment effect in the formal labour market and
a positive effect on the informal labour market(Carneiro, 2000). Lemos (2009) finds no evidence ofany employment effect for either formal or informalsector.
For Indonesia the minimum wage impact on the
formal and informal labour market indicates that theaverage wage for different subgroups of the labourmarket increases after minimum wage changes (Rama,2001; SMERU, 2001). However, at the same time for a
segment of the informal sector a negative wage impact
is found (Bird and Manning, 2002). In terms ofemployment impact a negative employment effect isfound among small, domestic firms or young andfemale workers (Rama, 2001; SMERU, 2001;
Alatas and Cameron, 2003). This is contradicted by
findings of informal employment increases (Bird andManning, 2002).
3A comprehensive overview of the literature on the effects of the minimum wage in Brazil can be found in Carneiro (2001) and
Lemos (2004b, 2009).

wage on the informal sector has been found in severalLatin American countries (Castillo-Freeman andFreeman, 1991; Bell, 1997; Montenegro and Pages,2003; Grindling and Terrell, 2004; Maloney andNunez, 2004). Several previous studies on theArgentine minimum wage have found evidence ofthe impact of the minimum wage on wages andemployment in the informal sector (Fizsbein, 1992;
FIEL, 2000; Szretter, 2004; Kostzer, 2006; Kristensen
and Cunningham, 2006; SEL Consultores, 2006).
In his study Beccaria (2004), who uses probit
analysis to estimate the probability of an individualremaining in the same labour market status after theminimum wage change as before the minimum wagechange, investigates the minimum wage impact onsalaried and nonregistered workers. Following apanel for Greater Buenos Aires for the period Mayto October 1993, he finds that the minimum wage hasno significant impact on employment. In his analysis
he leaves out potential wage impacts and does not
take advantage of the federal minimum wage as afeature to be exploited in the estimation strategy forthe 1993 minimum wage change.
For the recent minimum wage hikes after the
Argentine crisis in 2001/2002 Kostzer (2006) analysesthe changes of the minimum wage with descriptiveanalysis of household survey data and finds that theminimum wage seems to have a higher impact oninformal sector workers. He argues that further
empirical analysis of the minimum wage impact on
the informal sector is needed. SEL Consultores (2006)also conduct a descriptive analysis and come to thesame conclusion.
None of these studies on the Argentine minimum
wage though have employed the tools, kernel densitydistributions and difference-in-difference estimates,advocated in the minimum wage literature for devel-oped and developing countries to study minimumwage changes and their impact on the formal andinformal labour market. The only studies by Maloney
and Nunez (2004) and Kristensen and Cunningham
(2006) that examine the minimum wage in Argentina,among other countries in Latin America, employedkernel density wage distribution and found evidencein this analysis of the minimum wage impact on theinformal segment of the labour market. The focus ofthese studies though was not on minimum wagechanges, and the kernel density wage distributionswere only studied for one time point, 1998 or 2000respectively. There were no minimum wage changesin Argentina during these two time periods.
Contrary to the previous literature, my article
exploits the institutional features of the federal min-imum wage changes using empirical tools, kerneldensity distribution and difference-in-difference esti-
mation, from the US and UK minimum wage litera-ture to substantiate the claim of an impact and even a
higher impact of the minimum wage on the informal
sector’s wage distribution. In addition to that thisarticle studies the impact of specific minimum wagechanges on wages in the formal and informal sectorsand quantifies the impact which in this form has notbeen studied before in the Argentine case.
III. Background and Data
In this section I discuss the background, history and
developments over the period 1992–2005 of minimum
wages in Argentina, where the two quasi-experiments
of minimum wage changes occurred. In addition tothat informality in the labour market, the definitionand development over this period, are also high-lighted. Thereafter the household survey dataanalysed in this article are described.
Background on minimum wages and informality
Minimum wage history and developments in
Argentina. In 1950 Argentina ratified the
International Labour Organization (ILO) convention
on the minimum wage, which was rather unspecific in
terms of the minimum wage level, frequency and
regulation of minimum wage changes (Bienen, 2002).In 1964 the minimum wage was introduced officiallyin the Argentine labour law. By definition, theArgentine minimum wage intended to enable everyemployee that works 200 hours per month, to be ableto afford sufficient food, accommodation, education,clothing, health care and transport. According to this
law, no worker should be paid less than the minimum
wage. A national tripartite body of representatives ofthe state, employers and employees, a nationalcouncil, was established to determine the minimumwage level and adjustments. However, some changesin the law took place in 1978 and 1991, which grantedmore authority to the government, the Ministry ofLabour, in the minimum wage setting of this nationalcouncil. The minimum wage is set at federal level and
no province-level minimum wages exist.
Developments of the minimum wage changes and
increases are displayed in Table 1. The two minimum
wage changes of interest in this article were theminimum wage change in July 1993 and September2004.
In July 1993, after the hyperinflation period in
Argentina with several minimum wage changes toadjust for the erosion due to persistent inflation, thefirst official real minimum wage change of the 1990s
480 M. Khamis
----------------------------------------

[Page 6 of 20]
increased the minimum wage from 97 pesos to 200
pesos in nominal terms per month in July 1993. For the
period 1992 to 2005 these real and nominal minimumwage developments in Fig. 1 show that after the July1993 increases in both real and nominal terms, a
period of stable real and nominal wages followed, with
hardly any divergence between these two measures.The nominal level of 200 pesos was maintained untilafter the crisis in 2001. In 2001 during the onset of the
Argentine economic crisis a huge deterioration in the
minimum wage in real terms occurred, bringing thereal minimum wage to a level before the 1993 change.
Only in July 2003, about 10 years after the last
minimum wage increase, the labour minister autho-
rized an increase in the minimum wage for the first
time in a decade. The minimum wage was augmentedfrom 200 pesos to 250 pesos per month and therebystarted a minimum wage hike in the following
months, where the July level of 250 pesos was
increased by gradual 10 pesos until 300 pesos inDecember 2003. In January 2004 the minimum wage
was fixed at 350 pesos (MTSS, 2004). These minimum
wage changes after the economic crisis of 2001/2002were implemented by the Argentine governmentwithout the national council. The government
argued that the minimum wage increases were
necessary to counter the price increases after theeconomic crisis and for this reason were onlyre-instating the minimum wages effectiveness to
pre-crisis level (ME, 2005). As Fig. 1 shows the
minimum wage increases beginning in 2003 broughtthe minimum wage back to higher levels in real terms.
In August 2004 the national council met and
decided a further now official minimum wage
increase to 450 pesos for September 2004. Figure 2
examines the recent minimum wage changes throughan analysis of the actual purchasing power of a basicbasket of goods for Buenos Aires during the period
2000–2005, assuming the minimum wage is paid
for 200 hours worked in a month (ME, 2005).

After the large deterioration of the minimum wage
from the crisis and its subsequent recovery due to the
minimum wage increases after July 2003, the increaseto 450 pesos was the first minimum wage increase toraise the minimum wage further than the actual
pre-crisis levels. The hours worked to obtain a basketTable 1. Minimum wage changes, 1980–2005

4This basic basket differs from the official basket as it includes even fewer goods (ME, 2005). It includes the basic goods and
prices for the following items per month for which I collected the price data and estimated the hours of work needed to obtainthis basket: beef 6 kg, milk 7.5 l, dry noodles 4.5 kg, rice 3 kg, flour 1.5 kg, potato 6 kg, tomatoes 9 kg, bread 6 kg, coffee 600 g,
banana 9 kg, sugar 3 kg, oil 900 ml and butter 750 kg.
5In the Brazilian context, Lemos (2006) was able to study the impact of the minimum wage on aggregate prices with monthly
household and firm data. She finds price impacts of the minimum wage before, during and after minimum wage changes.Unfortunately, in the Argentine case it is not possible to test this due to data limitations and for now we have to assume that
agents did not respond pre-maturely to the minimum wage changes which are not as frequent as in the Brazilian case.

of basic good decreased for the first time since
October 2000.
Both Figs 1 and 2 showed that the two minimum
wage changes, which I analyse, in July 1993
and September 2004 were in fact real minimumwage changes and therefore one would expectthese changes to have an impact on the labourmarket.Informality in the labour market. To estimate the
impact of minimum wage changes on the formal andinformal labour market, the definition of informality
in the labour market and the development of infor-
mality over the time period of the two minimum wagechanges are important.

not have access or rights to a pension. This is coded
from the Argentine individual household surveyquestionnaire. Other definitions of labour informal-
ity, such as the ILO classification of low-productivity,
unskilled, marginal jobs as informal work, exist forArgentina (Gasparini, 2003; World Bank, 2006).Here, the legalistic definition, which is more closely
linked to the ideas of De Soto (1989) about the nature
of the informal sector, was employed to analyse the
coverage of two labour laws and regulations, theminimum wage and social security contributions,and the impact of changes in the minimum wage.
Workers without social security coverage might
still earn the minimum wage and changes in theminimum wage might increase the wages in theinformal sector.
This is also pointed out by Marshall (2004, p. 10):
‘Non-compliance needs not be uniform, for
instance, evasion of social security contributions cango hand in hand with compliance with the minimumwage [ ...], and in depth studies, are needed to establish
which legal constraints tend to be applied, and whichtend to be evaded.’In Fig. 3 the development of the share of informal
workers over the period 1990– 2005 increased. Arapid increase in informality occurred after the2001/2002 crisis. For the period around the two
minimum wage changes, 1993 and 2004, the
informality share in the labour market remainedrelatively stable.

Data
For the estimations in this article I mainly worked
with the Argentine national household surveys, thePermanent Household Survey (EPH) for the year1993 and the Continuous Permanent Householdsurvey (EPH-C) for the year 2004. For 1993 theMay and October waves around the July minimumwage change and for the 2004 the second trimesterand fourth trimester waves around the September
minimum wage change were worked with in the
estimations. In terms of data and the possibleestimations this gives rather a short-term effect.However, longer-term effects through the use of1994 or 1992 data would be very hard to account for2530354045

6To understand labour informality and aggregate changes over time, Gasparini (2002) employs decompositions to analyse the
effect of changes in the employment structure on the labour informality rate among workers in one local area, Buenos Aires.Here, I only use the informality rate as an illustration of the development but do not analyse the reason for informal work assuch. One possibility could be to look at changes in the rates of formal and informal workers over time, but this would go
beyond scope of this study due to focus on wages and not employment effects.

in an economy like Argentina.7In addition to that,
the data available for those years differed slightlyfrom the May and October 1993 waves. For thisreason taking the immediate household survey pro-ceeding and following the minimum wage policychange seemed most appropriate. Seasonal variationbetween the May and October rounds of the surveydoes not dramatically affect most statistics as the
surveys cover only urban areas (CEDLAS, 2004,
citing INDEC (2001)).
8
These household surveys cover about 31 urban areas
in the country and thereby cover about 60% of theArgentine population. The urban coverage wasextended over the years. The surveys in the early1990s, also the one in 1993, do not cover all the areasconsistently. Still, this includes the major urban areasof Argentina. In the estimation only urban areas,
which are in the May and October wave for 1993 are
included. So, in fact the repeated cross-section of urbanareas was employed in the estimations. In the trimesterdata for 2004, the codes for a restricted set of urbanareas were provided by the National Statistical Office(Instituto Nacional de Estadı ´stica y Censos (INDEC)).
The individual and household questionnaires cov-
ered questions relating to demographics, education,income, social security contribution and the labour
market. The household survey is a rotating panel of
urban households. The panel structure identification,although the individuals are repeated in the survey, isdifficult in the early 1990s due to the lack of codesprovided by INDEC. In the new EPH-C also some ofthe explicit codes for the identification of the panelwere not provided as well.
The minimum wage data were collected from the
Argentine Ministry of Labour and the Ministry ofEconomy (MTSS, 2004; ME, 2005). The Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) per province was obtained
from Province of Buenos Aires, Ministry ofEconomy, and Consumer Price Index (CPI) andprice data were collected from INDEC.
IV. Empirical Tests of the Impact of
Minimum Wage Changes on the
Informal Sector
This section describes the empirical tests and results
for the impact of the Argentine minimum wagechanges on the formal and informal labour market.In the first subsection I discuss the empirical strategy
for the 1993 minimum wage change and in the secondsubsection the results are presented. In the thirdsubsection a simple robustness check, using the 2004minimum wage change, is described.
Empirical strategy for the 1993 minimum wage
change
In the US and the UK empirical literature on the
minimum wage it has now become quite standard toexploit the occurrence of a minimum wage change, aquasi-experiment, as a source of exogenous variation(Card, 1992a, b; Card and Krueger, 1995). Toestimate the causal effect of minimum wages adifference-in-difference estimator before and afterthe minimum wage change is usually estimated foroutcome variables for two groups, the treatment andcontrol group. The main issue is the definition oftreatment and control group as the control groupprovides valuable information in the absence oftreatment, the counterfactual. For instance, compa-rable individuals at higher levels of the wage distri-bution can constitute the control group for theminimum wage earners (Currie and Fallick, 1996;Acemoglu and Pischke, 2003). However, for this to bea valid control group, it would require that weassume that there is no effect of minimum wagechanges on multiples of the minimum wage. Anothercommonly used control and treatment group followsthe well-known fast-food restaurant experiments inan affected state and not affected state by a minimum
wage change (Card and Krueger, 1995). Given that
the Argentine minimum wage might have a potentialripple effect at higher levels of the wage distributionand is also a national minimum wage, these twomethods are not applicable to form control andtreatment group.
Still, it is possible to design a control and treatment
group for a national minimum wage change whileexploiting regional variation. As Card (1992a)pointed out that ‘the national minimum wage is anunder-appreciated asset from the evaluation point ofview’. The federal minimum wage in combinationwith a high regional wage variation could be used inthe assessment of the impact of a minimum wagechange (Card, 1992a; Card and Krueger, 1995;Stewart, 2002).
7On one hand consistent coverage of the regions which are essential for the geographical variation in this article might not be
available over a longer time period. On the other hand economic developments in Argentina may not make it possible to
identify the effect of minimum wage change if a longer time period was employed (1991–1992: period of currency board andlarge-scale economic reforms, 1994–1995: Mexican ‘Tequila crisis’ growth impacts).
8Adjustment for seasonality does not seem to be necessary in this case. Moreover, the data limitations, in terms of
comparability of regions between 1992 and 1993, would make this difficult.484 M. Khamis
----------------------------------------

[Page 10 of 20]
The regional wage variation implies that the
minimum wage change would affect an initial pro-portion of ‘low-paid’ workers below the new mini-mum wage in each state, varying across the differentstates. The minimum wage bites to differing degrees
in an area’s wage distribution. The treatment andcontrol group are defined according to the potentialdifferential impact or biteof the new minimum wage
in the urban areas. The assignment of area ainto
control group, the low impact group, and into
treatment group, the high impact group, is determined
by this initial proportion of below the new minimumwage earners in the area. The differential impact ofthe minimum wage is the source of exogenousvariation in this estimation strategy.
The mean treatment on the treated effect, which is
the impact on the high impact group, is estimated as
the following difference-in-difference estimator
^/C18
DID¼ /C22Yat/C0 /C22Yat/C01/C0/C1
HI/C0 /C22Yat/C0 /C22Yat/C01/C0/C1
LIð1Þ
where the first bracket represent the two-period
difference of the mean outcome variable /C22Yfor the
high impact group HIat time t, after the minimum
wage change, and at time t/C01, before the minimum
wage change. Analogously, the second bracket is thetwo-period difference of the mean outcome variable
/C22Yfor the low impact group LI. Here, the outcome
variable /C22Yis wages, total, formal or informal sector.
This estimator is obtained from the followingregression:
Y
at¼/C130þ/C131Mtþ/C132Daþ/C18MtDaþ"at ð2Þ
where Mtis a time dummy that takes the value 1 for
October 1993 and 0 for May 1993. The treatmentdummy D
atakes the value 1 if area ais in the high
impact group and 0 if area ais in the low impact
group. The interaction term MtDais a dummy
variable for the observation being in the high impact
group after the minimum wage increase. Hence, /C18is
the true causal effect of the treatment on the outcomefor this group, which in turn is the estimator ofinterest ^/C18
DIDhere.
The key identifying assumption for the difference-
in-difference estimator here is that /C18would be 0 in the
absence of ‘treatment’. Basically, the underlying trendin outcome variable, wages, across the urban areas,control and treatment group, is assumed to be thesame in the absence of the minimum wage. Clearly,this can be a potential problem to this type ofestimation, a treat to validity (Meyer, 1995).Other factors could influence the results and this in
turn would make the identification of an effect of aminimum wage change on /C22Ydoubtful. Here, the error
term "
atcan be decomposed into several effects,
individual specific and common macroeconomiceffects, which cancel out through differencing.
9For
instance, if macroeconomic effects were to systemat-ically differ between high andlow impact groups then
the difference-in-difference estimator here would be
biased. The inclusion of a vector of characteristics X
0
at
as controls in the estimation of (2) can adjust for
observable difference between the observations of thetwo groups.
Thus the regression equation would be

at/C14þ"atð3Þ
In my estimations I adjusted for potential group level
differences, which might lead the minimum wagepolicy to systematically differ among the groups. Inparticular the concern was that the minimum wage
policy might interact differently with the local labour
market or economy across the high impact and low
impact groups over time.
The main identifying assumption of equal trends in
the outcomes for the high impact and low impact
groups is crucial. For example, during this timeperiod a shift in a sectoral industry to an industry,which employs more formal workers, in one areamight change the impact of the minimum wagepolicy. Another possibility could be also a local area
recovery, which is unrelated to the minimum wage
increase, but might have an impact on wages (Meyer,1995; Angrist and Krueger, 1999). To account forthese potential problems controls for the industrysector, the regional GDP and individual level con-trols, like age, gender and education were introducedduring the estimations.
Results
This section presents the results for the Argentine
minimum wage change in 1993.
10First, two tests for
the applicability of the proposed estimation strategyare offered. The first test examines whether theminimum wage does have an effect on the wagedistribution of the formal and informal labourmarket or not. The second test inspects whetherthere is a degree of geographical variation in the areawage distributions or not. After these two tests, I
discuss the difference-in-difference estimation results.
9Individual-level SEs need to allow for possible correlation between the error terms within a local urban area and need to be
adjusted for by clustering. The coefficient and sign remain the same but the SE would be different when clustered by urbanarea.
10Descriptive statistics and variable descriptions are given in Tables A1–A4 in the Appendix.

Test for minimum wage effect on wage
distribution. Before estimating the impact of the
minimum wage on the formal and informal sector
with the proposed empirical strategy, a test ofwhether the minimum wage has an impact on the
wage distribution, is in fact binding, was performed.
Kernel wage densities for the formal and informalwage distribution show that the informal wagedistribution lies to the left of the formal wage
distribution (Fig. 4). This result is consistent with
the findings by Maloney and Nunez (2004) for adifferent time period. The lower tails of the Kernel
wage densities show that the informal wage distribu-
tion has spikes around the old and new minimumwage levels, 97 and 200 pesos, respectively, while theformal wage distribution does not (Fig. 5). From
the cumulative wage distribution one can observe that
the lower end of the informal cumulative distributionlies above the formal distribution (Fig. 6). A higherpercent of informal workers is allocated at the lower
end of the wage distribution than formal workers at
those wage levels. Cliffs or steps in the distributionindicate whether the minimum wage is binding at
these wage level. A clustering of workers at these
wage levels point to the minimum wage being bindingat those levels (Kristensen and Cunningham, 2006).In the informal cumulative distribution the steps are
slightly more pronounced than for the formal
distribution.
Test for geographical variation. For the specific
estimator ^/C18
DID based on comparing high impact
and low impact groups of urban areas in Argentinato give believable results, certain conditions need to
be satisfied first:
(1) Wage distributions of the two groups, high
impact andlow impact , need to be significantly
different from each other (Stewart, 2002).
(2) A significant relationship with the fraction of
workers in an area initially below the new
minimum wage and the wage movements isnecessary (Stewart, 2002).
The main interest here is to test the variation of the
minimum wage’s bite in the different urban areas
wage distributions as this determines the distinction
between treatment and control group, high impact
andlow impact.

11In this article I have followed the estimation strategy of Stewart (2002) of high impact and low impact groups. To estimate an
alternative difference-in-difference estimator may not be possible due to data limitations and the institutional set-up of the
minimum wage.486 M. Khamis
----------------------------------------

[Page 12 of 20]
An initial look at the kernel density wage distribu-
tions by urban areas for total labour income providesan insight into the different area wage distributions
(Fig. 7). The variation of the bite, the proportion of
workers below the new minimum wage of 200 pesos(depicted by the second vertical line) varies, althoughat the lower end of the wage distribution in each
urban area, greatly between urban areas. In Fig. 8 the
percentage below the new incoming minimum wage isplotted by area. Clearly, there are several urbanareas, which exhibit a higher share of people below
the new minimum wage.
12These form the high impact
group while the remaining are classified as the low
impact group. The kernel wage densities for the
high impact and low impact groups have very
different wage distributions as the distribution of
thehigh impact group is located to the left of the
distribution for the low impact group (Fig. 9).
This result is very similar to Stewart (2002) whouses this econometric methodology for the UK
minimum wage introduction. Also followingStewart (2002), the two-period change for differentaspects of an area’s wage distribution is illustrated inFig. 10. Moving from areas with a low proportion ofemployees paid below the new minimum wage toareas with high percentage of below the minimumwage, the first percentile of the wage distribution
increases rapidly. Contrary to this the median and
mean of the distribution change relatively little andcertainly do not increase (Stewart, 2002). This yetagain is further evidence for geographical variation ofthe different urban areas at the lower end of the wagedistribution, where the minimum wage change bites.
Difference-in-difference estimation results. The tests
for binding of the minimum wage and geographicalvariation validate the use of the empirical strategyoutlined earlier and the estimations performed followthe template of Stewart (2002) and Card (1992a). For

the estimations of the wage outcomes, area-level
(unweighted) and individual-level (weighted) esti-mates, where the SE was adjusted for clustering were
calculated without and with controls (Tables 2–4).
From the area-level estimations, small positive, notsignificant coefficients for the informal wage areobtained. The wage impacts for formal workers had
large positive coefficients, but they were notsignificant either. The overall wage had a coefficient
that was negative and not significant. As none of the
coefficients were significant though, the conclusionfrom this mean area-level estimations seems thatthere was no wage impact of the minimum wage
change (Table 2).
13Contrary to this, the individual
estimations without controls produced a positivesignificant impact for the informal wage and overall
wage. For the formal sector wage it was also positive
and not significant (Table 3). Here, the wage impactof the minimum wage change has an impact on theinformal sector wage and wages in general. With the

13Given the short-run nature and the size of the country, migration or commuting between local labour markets to counter
the effect of the minimum wage does not seem plausible. To account for possible labour supply and overall growth effects,
I included GDP per province as control and the results did not change.488 M. Khamis

inclusion of a combination of different controls, local
area and individual controls, the magnitude of thedifference-in-difference estimates increased for all the
wage segments and measures (Table 4).
14
Overall, it is possible to say that there seems to be a
significant positive impact on the informal sectorwage and the overall wage distribution. The formalsector wage does not exhibit these properties and
remains not significant.Throughout the estimations data limitations in
terms of urban coverage, as mentioned might stillresult in potentially biased results and a robustness
check with another minimum wage change seems
appropriate.
A robustness check – the 2004 minimum wage
change
To check whether the results for the difference-in-
difference estimator for 1993 are in fact robust, Iperform a robustness check with another minimumwage change in 2004. Given data limitations due tochanges in the household survey, it was not possibleto apply the same difference-in-difference estimator.Bearing also in mind that the minimum wage changein September 2004 occurred after a period ofincreases in informality in the labour market, related
and unrelated to the Argentine economic crisis in
2001/2002, kernel density distribution for the infor-mal wage before the minimum wage change showed aclear spike at the old minimum wage of 350 pesos,which was the current minimum wage in the secondtrimester 2004 (Fig. 11). The formal sector wagedistribution does not display any spike at all while theinformal wage distribution does. The cumulative
distribution also exhibits a concentration and small
cliff in the informal sector wage and even small onefor the formal wage (Fig. 12). For the fourth trimester2004, after the minimum wage increase to 450 pesos,the kernel density for both, formal and informalsector exhibit a spike and even a plateau around theminimum wage while the cumulative distributionagain shows a small jump at the minimum wage(Figs 13 and 14). Hence, the minimum wage has a
continued impact on the wage distribution of the
informal sector and its change affects the informalwage.
V. Conclusion
The impact of labour laws and regulations on the
informal labour market has been the focus of theliterature on developing country labour markets.This article tested empirically the hypothesis oftenmentioned that the minimum wage does have animpact on the informal labour market, possibly evena stronger impact on the informal than formal labour
market. Exploiting quasi-experiments of minimum
wage changes and applying econometric techniques,kernel density graphs and difference-in-differenceTable 2. Area-level difference-in-difference estimate: wage

estimation, employed by the minimum wage litera-
ture in the US and the UK (Card, 1992a, b; Card andKrueger, 1995; Stewart, 2002), I found empiricalsupport that the minimum wage and minimum wagechanges have an impact on informal wages and even ahigher impact on informal sector wages than formalsector wages. The difference-in-difference estimationsfor the 1993 minimum wage change showed asignificant positive impact on informal sector wagedistribution and on overall wages. These results wererobust when looking at the kernel densities of a 2004minimum wage change. Data limitations with respectto the geographical coverage did not allow an
extension of the difference-in-difference estimator tothe 2004 case, which only allows visual inspections ofthe kernel densities. This makes the findings for 2004less convincing than the 1993 minimum wage analysisbased on kernel densities and difference-in-differenceestimates.
Following up the quote in the introduction with
empirical evidence, the Argentine minimum wage ismore effective among those who are regardedTable 4. Individual-level difference-in-difference estimate: wage impact – with controls

informal sector workers than in other segments of the
labour market.15Alighthouse effect , a term employed
if the minimum wage affects the wage determinationin the informal sector, is found to be the case for
Argentina.
These results are not only interesting for the
Argentine case, but also contribute to the broader
debate on the view of the labour market. In the
traditional view of the dual labour market by Harris
and Todaro (1970) the informal sector would have
experienced a wage decrease due to minimum wage
increases in the formal sector. After the minimumwage increase in the formal sector, some unemployed
workers of the formal sector would seek employmentin the informal sector, thereby driving informal sectorwages down. Yet, the results in this article do notsupport this view of the labour market as an increaseof informal sector wages, even stronger than formal
sector wages, was estimated. The overall effect of the
minimum wage was dominated by the informalsector. The dualistic model of the segmented labourmarkets does not seem to apply universally todeveloping country labour markets. The idea putforward that the minimum wage might serve as areference wage and noncompliance with labour leg-
islation is not practised on all levels seems to apply
(Marshall, 2004). Employers might pay the minimumwage but not comply with the social security regis-tration (Marshall, 2004; Kostzer, 2006; Kristensenand Cunningham, 2006). The other theoretical expla-nations for the minimum wage impact on theinformal sector wage, which might involve second
round impacts of the minimum wage change, might
play a role. However, due to the short-term effects ofminimum wages changes on the informal sector,investigated in this article, these explanations mightbe secondary in our case.
These findings raise the question which sets of
policies, not necessarily labour market policies, are
appropriate to address compliance with minimum
wages and social security contribution. To investigatethis future research on what barriers and incentivesexist on the employer level to comply with theminimum wage and not the social security systemwould provide further insight into the appropriatedesign of policies to address this dimension offormality–informality interaction in the labour
market.

15It could even be argued from the visual inspection of the formal wage distribution that the minimum wage does not bite very
much for formal sector workers. Levy (2008) argues that if informal workers sought formal employment this would drivedown formal wages. This in turn could potentially make a nonbinding minimum wage binding in the formal sector. In the
current short-term analysis we do not observe this behaviour of the formal wage.

Does an Increasing Minimum Wage Reduce FormalSector Employment? Evidence from Brazilfernando saltielMcGill Universitysergio urzúaUniversity of Maryland and National Bureau of Economic ResearchI. IntroductionLabor markets in Latin America are characterized by high employment costsand extensive regulations (Heckman and Pagés 2000). A common feature inthe region is the existence of legislated minimum wages, which, while varyingin scope and extent across countries, directly affect wages of formal sector work-ers (Maloney and Nuñez Méndez 2004; Kristensen and Cunningham 2006).While this tool is also prevalent in developed countries, the estimated effectsof the minimum wage on employment may differ across developed and devel-oping countries, given the existence of a large informal sector in the latter.In this paper, we examine the impacts of the minimum wage on various em-ployment measures in Brazil, the seventh-largest economy in the world. Be-tween 2003 and 2012, its real national minimum wage grew by 62%, far ex-ceeding the country’s cumulative economic growth in this time period (48%,based on GDP [gross domestic product]; PPP [purchasing power parity] con-stant 2011 dollars). Consequently, the Kaitz index, which measures the ratio ofthe minimum wage to the median wage, grew from 45% in 2003 to 58% in2012. Moreover, in 2000, the federal government instituted a law allowingstates to implement wage/uniFB02oors affecting employment in speci/uniFB01c industriesand occupations. To explore the effects of the national minimum wage and re-gional wage/uniFB02oors on employment outcomes, we take advantage of matchedemployee-employer data (RAIS [Relação Anual de Informações Sociais]), whichcovers the universe of formal sector workers and/uniFB01rms in Brazil for the 2003–12We thank the Banco de Desarrollo de America Latina for/uniFB01nancial support.

period. Moreover, RAIS includes/uniFB01rms’sector classi/uniFB01cation as well as rich geo-graphic information on local labor markets (microregions), allowing us to con-sider heterogeneous employment effects by exposure to the minimum wage.1To identify the effects of the minimum wage on formal sector employment,we/uniFB01rst follow the existing literature and leverage state-level variation in the in-cidence of the minimum wage, as measured by the Kaitz index. We/uniFB01nd that anincrease in the minimum wage is associated with negative employment elastic-ities that are not statistically signi/uniFB01cant,/uniFB01tting in with previous/uniFB01ndings presentedby Lemos (2004, 2009a, 2009b), Neumark, Cunningham, and Siga (2006),and Broecke and Vandeweyer (2016), among others. Nonetheless, using RAISdata we/uniFB01nd substantial within-state variation in the incidence of the minimumwage, as states explain less than half of the variance in microregion-level Kaitzindices. As a result, we conduct our empirical analysis at the microregion leveland/uniFB01nd employment elasticities that are not different from 0.The lack of disemployment impacts may be explained by the lack of inci-dence in the minimum wage, as fewer than 5% of workers earned wages aroundthe minimum wage (Engbom and Moser 2018). We thus estimate employmentelasticities for two groups highly exposed to minimum wages: workers in therestaurant and accommodation industry and high school dropouts. We/uniFB01ndlarger (negative) elasticities in the range of20.27 to20.12, yet these are smallerunder alternative incidence measures (Lemos 2009a) and are largely insigni/uniFB01-cant. Finally, we note that Brazil’s economic growth was fueled by a large com-modity price increase and that regions were differentially exposed to this shock.As a result, the minimum wage may result in heterogeneous employment effectsacross areas less exposed to the boom. We follow Benguria, Saf/uniFB01e, and Urzúa(2018) and use data from the 2000 census to measure microregion-level expo-sure to the commodity shock. We/uniFB01nd larger negative employment elasticitiesin microregions less exposed to the boom, indicating important within-countryheterogeneity in the estimated effects in light of macroeconomic conditions inBrazil during our time period of interest.We further analyze the impacts of regional wage/uniFB02oors on labor market out-comes. Since 2000,/uniFB01ve southeastern states have implemented such/uniFB02oors, andthese laws cover different categories of workers, making it dif/uniFB01cult to comparetheir impact across states. Nonetheless, we show that existing/uniFB02oors includeprovisions directly aimed toward workers in the restaurant and accommodation1In particular, we exploit detailed geographic information in RAIS to estimate the impacts acrossBrazil’s 558 microregions, each of which“groups together economically integrated contiguous mu-nicipalities [in the same state] with similar geographic and productive characteristics”(Dix-Carneiroand Kovak 2017, 2914).1404ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE

industry.2Since the existing literature has argued about whether wage/uniFB02oorssuccessfully raise wages (Terrell 2009; Tepedino 2013; Corseuil, Foguel, andHecksher 2015), we also consider their impact on this outcome. We/uniFB01rst esti-mate wage/uniFB02oor regressions including all microregions in the country, followingthe existing minimum wage literature (Card and Krueger 1994, 2000), and/uniFB01ndthat wage/uniFB02oors successfully raise wages among low-wage workers in the restau-rant and accommodation industry. On the other hand, we do not/uniFB01nd evidencethat wage/uniFB02oors result in signi/uniFB01cant disemployment effects. We consider the ro-bustness of the results by restricting the analysis to southeastern states and/uniFB01ndsimilar earnings and employment effects.However, wage/uniFB02oors may be set endogenously to labor market outcomesin the restaurant and accommodation sector. To address this concern, we fol-low Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010, 2016) and implement an alternative em-pirical strategy that compares outcomes in microregions with different wage/uniFB02oors lying on state borders. In this setting, the endogeneity concern is assuagedif states do not set wage/uniFB02oors in light of labor market outcomes in micro-regions lying on the state border. Thus, this strategy compares outcomes in ar-eas facing similar aggregate shocks but with different wage/uniFB02oors. We identify89 microregions on state borders that faced different/uniFB02oors at some point be-tween 2003 and 2012.3We document that bordering microregions are moresimilar vis-à-vis any other region in the sample, thus constituting valid con-trols. In this design, we/uniFB01nd similar earnings effects as in the full sample, indi-cating that wage/uniFB02oors increased wages in the restaurant and accommodationsector. We do not/uniFB01nd signi/uniFB01cant disemployment effects.4Moreover, we exam-ine whether the implementation of wage/uniFB02oors results in cross-state spilloversbut fail to/uniFB01nd evidence of such impacts. We additionally consider the robust-ness of our results to a matching estimator, which identi/uniFB01es the most closelymatched microregion for each treated microregion,/uniFB01nding similar results asin the other two speci/uniFB01cations. As a result, the combination of limited dis-employment effects arising from both the minimum wage and regional wage/uniFB02oors leads us to conclude that neither policy reduced formal sector employ-ment in Brazil between 2003 and 2012.2The restaurant and accommodation industry is de/uniFB01ned as a one-digit sector in Brazil.3These microregions constitute 138 microregion pairs, as microregions may be paired with morethan one counterpart.4While the US literature has debated the validity of this design because of differences in the estimatedemployment elasticities between the cross-border microregion (county)-pair design and the standardminimum wage speci/uniFB01cation (Neumark, Salas, and Wascher 2014; Allegretto et al. 2017; Neumarkand Wascher 2017), the robustness of our results to both speci/uniFB01cations indicates that such concernsare not relevant in the Brazilian context.Saltiel and Urzúa1405

This paper makes various contributions to the literature on the employmentimpacts of minimum wages in developing countries. First, within the Braziliancontext, by focusing the empirical analysis at the microregion level, we showthat state-level incidence measures miss an important source of variation. Con-sequently, the estimated employment elasticities across state- and microregion-level speci/uniFB01cations differ signi/uniFB01cantly. Furthermore, focusing the empiricalanalysis at this more granular level allows us to consider heterogeneous impactsby exposure to the commodity boom. And since RAIS data include detailed in-formation on industrial composition, we can examine the impacts of the mini-mum wage on industry-level employment outcomes, thus overcoming potentialmeasurement error concerns in survey data. In this way, this paper complementsan extensive literature exploiting variation in the incidence of the minimumwage to estimate employment impacts in Brazil (Fajnzylber 2001; Neri, Gon-zaga, and Camargo 2001; Lemos 2004, 2009a, 2009b; Neumark, Cunningham,and Siga 2006; Broecke and Vandeweyer 2016; Jales 2018) and in Latin Americamore generally (Strobl and Walsh 2003; Arango and Pachón 2004; Khamis2013; Maurizio and Vázquez 2016). We extend the existing literature by carry-ing out the analysis at the microregion level and examining heterogeneous im-pacts by industrial exposure to the minimum wage—/uniFB01tting in with existingwork in the United States focusing on the restaurant industry (Card and Krueger1994, 2000; Neumark and Wascher 2000; Dube, Lester, and Reich 2010). Fi-nally, by considering differential impacts by initial exposure to the commodityboom, we also contribute to previous work exploring the interaction betweenlabor market regulations and macroeconomic conditions (Micco and Pagés2006; Bassanini, Nunziata, and Venn 2009; Caballero et al. 2013).Second, by estimating the impact of wage/uniFB02oors on employment outcomes,this paper contributes to a growing literature exploiting within-country varia-tion in minimum wage policies in developing countries, including Gindlingand Terrell (2007, 2009, 2010), Alaniz, Gindling, and Terrell (2011), Ham(2018), and Wong (2019), among others. We present credible evidence regard-ing the impact of wage/uniFB02oors across the wage distribution in the restaurant andaccommodation industry, extending previous/uniFB01ndings presented in Terrell(2009), Tepedino (2013) and Corseuil, Foguel, and Hecksher (2015). More-over, we address potential endogeneity concerns in the implementation of thewage/uniFB02oors by adapting the cross-border county-pair design in Dube, Lester,and Reich (2010, 2016) to the Brazilian context. We show that cross-statemicroregions constitute credible controls. We present the/uniFB01rst estimated em-ployment elasticities of wage/uniFB02oors, failing to/uniFB01nd signi/uniFB01cant disemploymenteffects. Our results are robust to concerns raised by Neumark, Salas, andWascher (2014) and Neumark and Wascher (2017).1406ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE

The paper proceeds as follows. Section II discusses the institutional contextin Brazil, the relevant minimum wage and wage/uniFB02oor increases, the administra-tive data sources used in the paper, and summary statistics. Section III presentsour empirical strategy and results of the impacts of the national minimum wageon various employment measures. Section IV describes our contiguous micro-region border-pair strategy and displays our estimated results of wage/uniFB02oors onemployment in the restaurant and accommodation sector. Section V discussesthe results and concludes.II. Institutional Context and Data SourcesA. Institutional Context1. National Minimum WageThe minimum wage in Brazil was initially implemented in 1940 at the statelevel, becoming uniform at the national level in 1984, with no subminimumor differentiated minimum wage rates for speci/uniFB01c groups of workers. The min-imum wage covers workers employed in the formal sector, and the Ministry ofLabor often carries out inspections to ensure that/uniFB01rms comply with minimumwage regulations (Almeida and Carneiro 2009). However, the prevalence of theinformal sector, accounting for half of employment in Brazil (Dix-Carneiroand Kovak 2019), implies that/uniFB01rms may skirt compliance with the minimumwage by employing informal workers. Nonetheless, the minimum wage maystill affect informal sector wages through the posited“lighthouse effect”(Souzaand Baltar 1979), in which minimum wage increases result in correspondingchanges in informal sector wages.5As a result, any negative employment effectsin the formal sector may be potentially attenuated as a result of the lighthouseeffect.While the value of the real minimum wage had varied substantially acrosshigh- and low-in/uniFB02ation periods in Brazil in the 1980s and 1990s (Lemos2006; Neumark, Cunningham, and Siga 2006), it has undergone a signi/uniFB01cantincrease in recent years. Between 2003 and 2012, the real minimum wage grewby a total of 62%, reaching a value of 622 Brazilian reais (USD 410, PPP-adjusted) per month by the end of the period.6In the context of Brazil’s sus-tained economic growth in this time period, we consider whether the minimum5Fajnzylber (2001), Neri, Gonzaga, and Camargo (2001), and Lemos (2004) provide evidence ofthis phenomenon in Brazil. Gindling and Terrell (2007) present similar evidence in Costa Rica, andMaloney and Nuñez Méndez (2004) do so across Latin America.6In 2006, the government introduced a rule to increase the minimum wage by the sum of in/uniFB02ationin the previous year and the average GDP growth rate in the two previous years. This rule has beenrenewed twice since, and the minimum wage increases have often exceeded the minimum mandatedby law.Saltiel and Urzúa1407

wage became more binding over time by exploiting the Kaitz index (Kaitzt5MWt=wp50t), wherewp50tmeasures median formal sector wages in Brazil in periodt.The Kaitz index, which captures the ratio of the minimum wage to medianmonthly earnings, grew from 45% in 2003 to 58% in 2012 (/uniFB01g. 1). Thischange was accompanied by a 50% increase in the size of the formal sector,which incorporated upward of 40 million workers between 2003 and 2012.We note that since only 4%–6% of formal sector workers earned salaries withina 5% band of the minimum wage in this time period (Engbom and Moser2018), the disemployment impacts arising from minimum wage increasesmay be muted in the full sample. Our empirical analysis thus considers hetero-geneous impacts across workers, industries, and regions differentially exposedto minimum wage increases.2. State-Level Wage FloorsIn 2000, the federal government of Brazil instituted a law allowing states to in-troduce wage/uniFB02oors above the national minimum wage, which could selectivelyapply to certain occupations and/or industries. Since then,/uniFB01ve states have in-troduced such policies: Rio de Janeiro in 2000, Rio Grande do Sul in 2001,Paraná in 2006, São Paulo in 2007, and Santa Catarina in 2009. These statesare all located in the southeastern region of the country and are among the

Both values are calculated with RAIS data for the 2003–12 period.1408ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE

richest states in Brazil. While this policy could theoretically allow us to exploitwithin-country variation in wage/uniFB02oors in our empirical analysis, estimatingtheir impact is not straightforward, as the occupations and industries varyacross states. For instance, while Rio de Janeiro’s law de/uniFB01nes the wage/uniFB02oorby occupational categories, Rio Grande do Sul’s policy is de/uniFB01ned at the indus-try level. Moreover, these policies include various wage/uniFB02oors for different cat-egories of workers, and these categories have shifted over time (Corseuil,Foguel, and Hecksher 2015).Despite the heterogeneous implementation of the wage/uniFB02oor across states,all policies include explicit provisions affecting employment in the restaurantand accommodation industry. In appendix A, we show that Rio Grande doSul, São Paulo, and Santa Catarina include/uniFB02oors that directly affect workersin the“restaurant”and“tourism and accommodation”industries. Meanwhile,Rio de Janeiro has a speci/uniFB01c/uniFB02oor covering busboys, cooks, and servers—whoaccount for a large share of employment in restaurants—and tourism and ac-commodation workers. Likewise, Paraná includes a/uniFB02oor for workers in a one-digit occupational group that accounts for the majority of employment in therestaurant and accommodation industry.7In this context, we create a state-levelwage/uniFB02oor variable, presented in/uniFB01gure 2, that tracks the relevant/uniFB02oor in eachstate for workers employed in this one-digit industry and compare it to the na-tional minimum wage.8As shown in the/uniFB01gure, since wage/uniFB02oors are adjustedin different months across states, we analyze outcomes on a quarterly basis, tocorrectly measure within-year variation in these/uniFB02oors. Finally, given the ongo-ing debate in the literature about the effectiveness of the wage/uniFB02oors (Terrell2009; Tepedino 2013; Corseuil, Foguel, and Hecksher 2015), our empiricalanalysis examines the extent to which regional/uniFB02oors affect wages.B. Data SourcesWe use data from the RAIS database for the 2003–12 period. RAIS containslinked employee-employer data from a mandatory annual survey/uniFB01lled in byall registered/uniFB01rms in the formal sector in Brazil, thus constituting a census of7Since other workers in this sector earn higher wages than busboys and servers (such as managers),we consider these/uniFB02oors as binding for any formal employment in the restaurant industry. Since therestaurant and accommodation industry is de/uniFB01ned as a one-digit sector in Brazil, we focus our em-pirical analysis on the impacts of regional wage/uniFB02oors on employment outcomes in this sector.8In the speci/uniFB01c cases in which two different provisions apply to workers in this sector—such as in Riode Janeiro, where one/uniFB02oor applies to busboys and a higher one applies to servers, as well as RioGrande do Sul and Paraná, with different/uniFB02oors for restaurant and accommodation workers—ourvariable includes the lower of the two, though our empirical results are not sensitive to this choice.These results are available upon request.Saltiel and Urzúa1409

formal sector employment in the country.9We observe/uniFB01rms’geographic loca-tion down to the municipality level, which allows us to construct employmentmeasures at various levels of geographic aggregation.10Thus, RAIS data allow usto extend the minimum wage literature in Brazil—which has largely analyzedstate-level outcomes—to examine employment outcomes at/uniFB01nely de/uniFB01ned geo-graphic levels. In particular, we focus on Brazil’s 558 microregions, comprised ofcontiguous municipalities with similar economic characteristics, which repre-sent local labor markets resembling commuting zones in the United States.11
Figure 2.Regional wage/uniFB02oors: level of the lowest regional/uniFB02oor affecting employment in the restaurant and ac-commodation industry in each state in Brazil. These values are measured quarterly, given the frequency of adjust-ment of the wage/uniFB02oors. For the nonimplementing states, the wage/uniFB02oors are determined by the national minimumwage, as discussed in sec. II. A color version of this/uniFB01gure is available online.
9The survey has been administered by the Brazilian Ministry of Labor since 1986 and reached com-plete coverage of formal sector/uniFB01rms by 1994. As the Ministry of Labor has been known to levy/uniFB01neson late and/or inaccurate reports,/uniFB01rms tend to hire specialized accountants to ensure the correctcompletion of the RAIS survey, resulting in highly accurate data.10There are 5,570 municipalities in Brazil, which are aggregated into 558 microregions and27 states.11Previous work in the international trade literature has focused its analysis at the microregion level(Adão 2015; Dix-Carneiro and Kovak 2017, 2019), given substantial heterogeneity in labor marketoutcomes within states. As a result, household survey data, such as the Pesquisa Nacional porAmostra de Domicilios, which captures geographic information at the state level, cannot accountfor such heterogeneity.1410ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE

[Page 9 of 36]
The administrative nature of RAIS allows us to observe the start and endmonth for each job for each worker as well as individual-level characteristicssuch as age, gender, educational attainment, and occupation, allowing us toconsider heterogeneous outcomes across workers’observed characteristics.12In terms of earnings measures, RAIS includes information on average grossmonthly labor earnings, including regular salary payments, holiday bonuses,performance-based and commission bonuses, tips, and pro/uniFB01t-sharing agree-ments. Finally, we observe each/uniFB01rm’s industry, which we use to construct em-ployment and earnings measures across economic sectors.13For our aggregateemployment measure, we use the number of full-time equivalent workers dur-ing the reference quarter, which adjusts for workers who were not employed forall three months in the quarter and/or for those working less than the standard44 hours per week. We complement RAIS with data from Brazil’s StatisticalAgency (IBGE [Instituto Brasileiro de Geogra/uniFB01a e Estatística]) to construct an-nual microregion-level population, economically active population (aged 15–59), population density, and real GDP per capita measures. Furthermore, wefollow Benguria, Saf/uniFB01e, and Urzúa (2018) and use data from Brazil’s 2000 de-mographic census to construct microregion-level exposure to the subsequentcommodity boom.14III. Employment Effects of National Minimum WageA. State-Level AnalysisWhile the minimum wage does not vary within Brazil, there is substantialcross-state heterogeneity in its binding nature, as shown by state-level Kaitz in-dices presented in table B1. For example, the ratio of the 2003 minimum wageto the median wage in low-income northeastern states such as Ceará and Piauíexceeds 60% while remaining below 36% in São Paulo. In this context, the ex-isting literature in Brazil has leveraged over-time changes in state-level Kaitz-like incidence ratios to identify the employment impacts of the minimum wage(Lemos 2004, 2009a, 2009b; Broecke and Vandeweyer 2016). In fact, column 3of table B1 shows that while the Kaitz index increased in all states between2003 and 2012, there are differential increases across the country. Nonetheless,12While RAIS data are collected on an annual basis, observing the dates of entry and exit for all work-ers allows us to construct measures of relevant wage and employment outcomes at the quarterly level.13Our industry-level analysis focuses on all employment in the restaurant and accommodation sec-tor, which includes four different six-digit restaurant industries and four different six-digit hoteltypes.14We de/uniFB01ne commodity exposure by calculating employment shares in the following 14 commodity-based industries: cereals, cotton, sugarcane, soybeans, citrus, coffee, cacao, bovine meat, ovine meat,poultry meat, coal, oil and gas, metallic minerals, and precious metals, which account for a sizableshare of commodity-based employment in Brazil.Saltiel and Urzúa1411

the minimum wage increase in this time period successfully increased earningsacross high- and low-income states, such as Rio de Janeiro and Piauí, respec-tively (/uniFB01g. B1). To examine the effects of the minimum wage on employmentoutcomes, we/uniFB01rst follow the existing literature and estimate the followingregression:yst5a1oKk51gklnðKaitzstÞðÞk1a1Xst1lt1oPr50vstr1εst, (1)whereystrepresents state-level annual employment outcomes, Kaitzstrepre-sents the Kaitz index, and we include polynomials of orderKaccounting forpotential miniregion-speci/uniFB01c effects (Lee 1999; Autor, Manning, and Smith2016; Engbom and Moser 2018). InXstwe control for labor supply shifters(economically active population) and macroeconomic conditions (state-levelreal GDP);ltcaptures year/uniFB01xed effects, andvsincludes state/uniFB01xed effects(r50), along with linear time trends (r51), depending on the speci/uniFB01ca-tion. We cluster standard errors at the state level.Equation (1) represents the reduced-form version of an employment-demand equation—since this speci/uniFB01cation includes median wages in the denom-inator, it could be understood as an approximation of a demand equation oflow-skilled workers relative to their higher-skilled counterparts. In equation (1),we recover the employment impacts of the national minimum wage by exploit-ing over-time variation in how the minimum wage drives changes in state-level Kaitz ratios (Neumark and Wascher 1992, 1994; Card and Krueger 1995;Kambayashi, Kawaguchi, and Yamada 2013; Dolton, Bondibene, and Stops2015; Caliendo et al. 2018). Formally, we assume that the variation comingfrom the Kaitz ratio is conditionally mean independent of the error term. Tothe extent that our speci/uniFB01cations control for year and microregion/uniFB01xed effects,minimum wages are set at the national level, and average/median wages re-spond to within-period and local shocks, this exogeneity assumption should/uniFB01t reasonably well to the Brazil context.The/uniFB01rst two columns of table 1 present the estimated impacts of the min-imum wage on formal sector employment at the state level. Column 1 indi-cates that a 10% increase in the Kaitz index is associated with a 2.5% decreasein formal sector employment, yet the coef/uniFB01cient is not statistically signi/uniFB01cant.In column 2, to capture potential nonlinearities in this relationship we includea second-order polynomial and present the estimated marginal effects evalu-ated at the minimum wage evaluated at the mean. We/uniFB01nd a slightly larger,yet insigni/uniFB01cant, point estimate (20.293). In columns 3 and 4, we consideran alternative incidence measure capturing the ratio of the minimum wage to1412ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE

To assess the robustness ofthese results, we additionally include state-level linear trends. The estimatedresults, presented in table B2, similarly show negative employment elasticitiesfor the Kaitz ratio in the range of20.23, which are signi/uniFB01cantly smaller whenthe Kaitz mean index is considered.16Our results/uniFB01t in with the existing liter-ature in Brazil, which has largely found limited disemployment impacts arisingfrom the minimum wage.17Nonetheless, state-level estimates miss an important source of heterogeneityin the incidence of the minimum wage. In/uniFB01gure B2, we present microregion-level Kaitz indices in 2003, which show substantial within-state variation. Forinstance, within the state of São Paulo, the Kaitz index in the São Paulomicroregion equals 16%, while it exceeds 41% in the Birigui microregion.

Columns 1 and 3 follow a linear spec-i/uniFB01cation of the Kaitz ratio, and cols. 2 and 4 include a quadratic term to account for nonlinearities. Annualmeasures of real GDP and the economically active population are constructed from IBGE data and de/uniFB01nedas the natural logarithms of these variables. Standard errors (in parentheses) are clustered at the state level.
15Throughout the rest of the paper, we refer to this measure as the“Kaitz mean”measure.16The inclusion of state linear trends implies that the employment elasticities are identi/uniFB01ed from dif-ferences in the Kaitz index (and employment outcomes) vis-à-vis state-level trends in the 2003–12 pe-riod. As noted by Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010), including state-level linear trends aims to account forendogenous minimum wage increases in the context of negative employment levels and trends. How-ever, since we consider a nationally set minimum wage, this is not a signi/uniFB01cant concern in our context.17For instance, Lemos (2004, 2009a, 2009b), Neumark, Cunningham, and Siga (2006), andBroecke and Vandeweyer (2016) use data from an employment survey covering six metropolitan re-gions in Brazil and/uniFB01nd employment elasticities that are generally smaller than20.10, with varyingstatistical signi/uniFB01cance.Saltiel and Urzúa1413

fact, a variance decomposition exercise indicates that states account for lessthan 40% of the variation in 2003 microregion-level Kaitz indices. Our pre-ferred empirical strategy thus extends the existing literature in Brazil by lever-aging changes in microregion-level incidence measures.B. Microregion-Level AnalysisFigure 3 displays changes in the Kaitz index at the microregion level between2003 and 2012. While the incidence of the minimum wage increased in mostregions, there is signi/uniFB01cant heterogeneity both within and across states, as theKaitz index fell in 118 microregions—generally located in the northeasternpart of the country. Our empirical strategy exploits variation in this incidencemeasure over time. We thus reestimate equation (1) at the microregion level asfollows:

the minimum wage. At the industry level, we focus on employment impacts inthe restaurant and accommodation sector, as the low-wage nature of the tasksrequired in this industry implies high exposure to minimum wage increases.In fact, 39% of workers in this sector earn monthly salaries below 110% ofthe minimum wage. We note that the analysis of heterogeneous impacts acrosshighly exposed groups relies on the same identifying variation as for the fullsample. Speci/uniFB01cally, we examine whether differential changes in the incidenceof the minimum wage result in disparate impacts in employment outcomesfor these two groups.We estimate equation (2) using formal sector employment in the restaurantand accommodation industry and present the results in panel A of table 3.

Heterogeneity by Commodity Sector ExposureWe have so far found limited employment impacts arising from the minimumwage. Nonetheless, during our time period of interest, Brazil’s economy under-went a signi/uniFB01cant economic boom, which may mute the potential effects of theminimum wage during a downturn. While equation (2) directly controls fortime trends in the economy, it does not allow us to discern whether thereare heterogeneous effects across regions with differential exposure to the com-modity boom, which was the key driver of Brazil’s economic success in 2003–12 (Benguria, Saf/uniFB01e, and Urzúa 2018). As a result, we reestimate equation (2),interacting minimum wage incidence measures with the commodity exposurevariable de/uniFB01ned in section II as follows:ymt5a1oKk51gklnðKaitzmtÞðÞk1oKk51hklnðKaitzmtÞðÞk/C2lowm1a1Xmt1lt1oPr50vmtr1εmt:(3)

Microregion-level exposure to the commodity boom is de/uniFB01ned using employ-ment shares in the 2000 census. We classify microregions as high or low expo-sure, and lowmis a dummy variable for low-exposure areas. We estimate equa-tion (3) using a linear speci/uniFB01cation of the Kaitz index, include microregionlinear time trends, and cluster standard errors at the microregion level.We present our empirical results in table 4 for aggregate formal sector em-ployment, employment in the restaurant and accommodation industry, andlow-skilled employment. Across the three employment indicators, we/uniFB01nd largernegative employment elasticities in microregions that were less exposed to thecommodity boom in Brazil during 2003–12. For instance, column 1 showsthat a 10% increase in the Kaitz index was associated with a 3.1% reductionin formal sector employment in less exposed microregions. We similarly/uniFB01ndnegative employment elasticities across the industry and education employ-ment measures, with varying statistical signi/uniFB01cance.

that the identi/uniFB01cation of the employment impacts presented so far relies onover-time changes in the Kaitz ratio at the microregion level. We thus comple-ment this analysis by taking advantage of the introduction of state-level wage/uniFB02oors in the next section.IV. Employment Impacts of State-Level Wage FloorsThe passage of the 2000 law allowing Brazilian states to implement wage/uniFB02oors—and its subsequent implementation by/uniFB01ve states—allows us to exploitvariation in this policy within Brazil to examine its impact on labor market out-comes. As discussed in section II, since the/uniFB02oors implemented by all states in-cluded a direct component targeting employment in the restaurant and accom-modation industry, we examine the effect on labor market outcomes in thissector. Since the existing literature has debated whether state wage/uniFB02oors ef-fectively raised wages (Terrell 2009; Tepedino 2013; Corseuil, Foguel, andHecksher 2015), we follow Cengiz et al. (2019) and examine the impact acrossthe wage distribution in this industry. We further consider potential disem-ployment impacts arising from the regional wage/uniFB02oors. In light of substantialheterogeneity in labor market outcomes within states, we focus on micro-regions exhibiting positive employment in this sector each year in the sample.Our/uniFB01rst empirical strategy leverages variation in the wage/uniFB02oors across micro-regions over time.19We estimate the following regression:ymt5b01b1lnðfloorstÞ1b2Xmt1lt1oPr50gmtr1εmt, (4)whereymtrepresents a wage or employment outcome in the restaurant and ac-commodation industry,/uniFB02oorstcaptures the binding/uniFB02oor affecting employmentin this sector in year-quartert,Xstfollows equation (1) and controls for theeconomically active population and real GDP ,ltdenotes year-quarter/uniFB01xedeffects, andgmtrincludes microregion/uniFB01xed effects along with microregion-level time trends.

Columns 1–3 display the estimated impact ofthe wage/uniFB02oors at different percentiles of the wage distribution in the restaurantand accommodation industry. We/uniFB01nd that a 10% increase in regional wage/uniFB02oor increases salaries at the 10th percentile of the wage distribution by1.8%. We additionally/uniFB01nd a statistically signi/uniFB01cant impact on 25th percentile19We conduct our empirical analysis at the quarterly level, given the staggered implementation of thewage/uniFB02oors throughout the year, as shown in/uniFB01g. 2.Saltiel and Urzúa1419

wages, which increase by 1.3% following a 10% increase in the wage/uniFB02oor. Theestimated wage impact fades out by the median of the distribution, however.20We remark that the estimated coef/uniFB01cients on the wage distribution/uniFB01t in withthe implementation of the wage/uniFB02oors, which have largely focused on low-wageoccupations within this sector, as shown in appendix A. As a result, our analysisclari/uniFB01es previous discrepancies in the literature regarding the wage impacts ofthese policies, as the effects can be identi/uniFB01ed only with data encompassing thewage distribution across targeted industries.Since wage/uniFB02oors effectively increase targeted workers’wages, in column 4we also analyze whether they affect employment outcomes. The estimated im-pact of regional wage/uniFB02oors on employment in the restaurant and accommo-dation sector is not statistically different from 0. Similar to Dube, Lester, andReich (2010), the estimated effect allows us to rule out negative employmentelasticities lower than20.30 at the 95% con/uniFB01dence level. Since only/uniFB01vehigh-income southeastern states adopted wage/uniFB02oors, in table B3 we examinethe robustness of the results by limiting the sample to these states, as well asEspírito Santo, Minas Gerais, and Mato Grosso do Sul, three states contiguousto wage/uniFB02oor adopters. We similarly/uniFB01nd that wage/uniFB02oors increased wages atthe bottom of the distribution while resulting in limited employment impacts.TABLE 5ESTIMATED IMPACTS OF REGIONAL WAGE FLOORS ON RESTAURANT AND ACCOMMODATION INDUSTRY OUTCOMESwp10wp25wp50Employment(1) (2) (3) (4)MW .176*** .135** .0882.073(.030) (.058) (.062) (.116)Real GDP2.024* .003 .025 .094**(.014) (.011) (.019) (.045)Population aged 15–592.2832.2092.057 .931**(.231) (.161) (.188) (.396)Observations 21,120 21,120 21,120 21,120Note.This table presents evidence on the estimated effects of regional wage/uniFB02oors on formal sectorwage and employment outcomes in the restaurant and accommodation industry at the microregion level.The estimated results follow from eq.

Cross-border microregion-pair design.—A potential concern about the empir-ical strategy implemented in equation (4) is that wage/uniFB02oors could be set en-dogenously to employment trends in the restaurant and accommodation sec-tor. We thus consider an alternative empirical strategy robust to this concern.Following Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010, 2016), we compare employment out-comes in microregions lying on the borders of states with different wage/uniFB02oorsduring our time period of interest.21Focusing on state-border microregions ad-dresses the endogeneity concern if states do not set wage/uniFB02oor policies solely inresponse to employment outcomes in these microregions. As a result, we com-pare microregions facing similar aggregate shocks with different wage/uniFB02oorsacross the state border. Moreover, as these microregions lie on opposite sidesof a state border, they may be more similar in observed characteristics vis-à-vismicroregions in the rest of the country. We provide evidence on this point below.While there are 558 microregions in Brazil, only/uniFB01ve states implementedwage/uniFB02oors between 2003 and 2012. Since our empirical strategy relies onmicroregions on state borders with differential wage/uniFB02oors, the cross-state sam-ple includes 89 microregions largely located in the southeastern part of thecountry (/uniFB01g. 4). Since these microregions may have more than one adjacentmicroregion across the state line, they can be part of multiple cross-border pairs.In fact, the 89 microregions in our sample belong to 138 unique cross-state bor-der pairs. In table 6, we present summary statistics for the full microregion sam-ple as well as the CBMP sample. Microregions in the cross-state design tend tohave smaller populations and lower population density and formal sector em-ployment while having higher GDP per capita and higher formal sector monthlysalaries.22Despite the differences in observed characteristics across the two samples,the identifying assumption in this setup is that bordering microregions con-stitute valid controls across states. To assess the validity of this assumption,we follow Dube, Lester, and Reich (2016) and test for differences in observedcharacteristics between contiguous microregions and the rest of the sample.2321Dube, Lester, and Reich (2010, 2016) focus their empirical analysis on counties with differentminimum wages across state borders in the United States. We focus our analysis at the microregionlevel—which represent a coarser level of geography than counties—to compare employment effectsacross units of similar economic importance. Throughout the rest of the paper, we refer to this strat-egy as the cross-border microregion-pair (CBMP) approach.22Across the full and CBMP samples, employment in the restaurant and accommodation industryaccounts for 3% of all formal sector employment, and average wages in this sector are 25% lowerthan in the rest of the economy.23We consider the following variables: microregion-level population, economically active popula-tion, population density, GDP per capita, and formal sector employment size, along with medianand average salaries in the formal sector.Saltiel and Urzúa1421

We implement this test by comparing the absolute difference in observed char-acteristics between each microregion in the CBMP sample and (1) its border-ing microregion pair and (2) every noncontiguous microregion not in the samestate.24We present the estimated results in table 7. In columns 1 and 2, weshow average absolute differences in labor market outcomes, economic activity,

24Noncontiguous out-of-state microregions represent the alternative control group. We implementthe test as follows. First, we compare each microregion in the CBMP sample against its borderingmicroregion and calculate the absolute difference in each relevant covariate. We then calculate theabsolute differences in observed characteristics for each of the 89 microregions in the CBMP sampleagainst each possible out-of-state microregion, yielding a total of 39,840 pairings. For each microregionin the sample, we thus can calculate the average difference against (1) bordering microregions and (2) allother microregions. We cluster standard errors multidimensionally on both microregions in the cross-state microregion pair.1422ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE

and population measures across noncontiguous and contiguous microregions,respectively. Across all variables, microregions in the CBMP sample are moresimilar to their bordering pairs than to noncontiguous microregions, and thesedifferences are statistically signi/uniFB01cant at the 1% level.25In fact, using borderingmicroregions as controls instead of the full sample reduces the average gapacross these seven variables by 37.4%, indicating that bordering microregionsconstitute more adequate controls for recovering the labor market impacts ofwage/uniFB02oors. Our estimating equation is as follows:ympt5a01a1lnðfloorstÞ1a2Xmt1gm1tpt1εmpt, (5)whereymptmeasures a wage or employment outcome in microregionmbelong-ing to border pairpin year-quartert;gmis a microregion/uniFB01xed effect, andtptrepresents pair-year-quarter/uniFB01xed effects, which absorb regional economicshocks in each bordering pair. As in equation (4), we/uniFB01rst cluster standard errorsat the state level, as wage/uniFB02oors are determined by states. However, micro-regions in the CBMP sample may be included more than once. Thus, the pres-ence of the same microregion across multiple border pairs would introduce amechanical correlation across pairs. To control for this, we further cluster stan-dard errors at the border-segment level—comprised of all microregions in eachborder in the CBMP sample—using multidimensional clustering.26We present results in table 8. In columns 1–3, we show the estimated im-pacts of wage/uniFB02oors across the wage distribution in the restaurant and accom-modation sector. Similar to the results presented in table 5, a 10% increase inregional wage/uniFB02oors lead to a 1.9% increase in wages at the 10th percentile ofthe wage distribution in this sector. While the estimated coef/uniFB01cient is smallerthan in the full sample, it remains statistically signi/uniFB01cant. The estimated im-pacts on wages in the 25th and 50th percentiles remain positive but are notstatistically signi/uniFB01cant,/uniFB01tting in with the results in the full microregion sample.We examine last whether wage/uniFB02oor increases lead to disemployment impactsin microregions in the CBMP sample. We present the results in column 4 oftable 8, where we/uniFB01nd that the employment elasticity associated with wage/uniFB02oorsis not statistically different from 0. In fact, we can rule out employment elastic-ities lower than20.15 at the 95% con/uniFB01dence level.27Despite the difference in25For instance, while the average difference in median salaries between bordering pairs equals83 reais, the corresponding difference between noncontiguous microregions exceeds 115 reais.26For instance, all microregions on both sides of the Paraná–Santa Catarina border represent a bordersegment, as do the microregions on the São Paulo–Minas Gerais border.27The estimated results presented in tables 5 and 8 are robust to including time-varying populationdensity, industry value added, and quadratic terms of all control variables.

contexts, our estimated employment elasticities are remarkably similar to thosefound in the United States (Dube, Lester, and Reich 2010, 2016).In this context, spillover effects constitute a potential threat to identi/uniFB01cationin the CBMP sample. For instance, the implementation of high wage/uniFB02oors inone state may lead workers in a contiguous state to migrate to the state with thehigher/uniFB02oor and thus mute potential disemployment impacts. To test for thepresence of spillover effects, we compare the wage and employment impactson border microregions to those in the interior of each state, which are unlikelyto be affected by spillovers. In particular, we estimate the following regression:ðympt2ystÞ5a01a1lnðfloorstÞ1a2ðXmt2XstÞ1gm1tpt1εmpt, (6)whereystrefers to the average employment (or earnings) of restaurant workers inthe interior microregions of statesin year-quartertand serves as a control forpossible spillover effects. In equation (6),a1thus captures the impact of the wage/uniFB02oor in the border-pair microregion relative to its state interior, compared to thecontiguous microregion across the border.28Table B4 presents the/uniFB01ndings.

/uniFB01rst note that wage/uniFB02oors do not result in signi/uniFB01cant spillover effects on earningsoutcomes in the restaurant and accommodation industry (cols. 1–3). In col-umn 4, we show that there are not any associated spillover effects on employ-ment in this industry,/uniFB01tting in with evidence presented in the United States.To further assess the robustness of our results, we introduce an additionalempirical approach, which largely follows a matching design. For each of the89 treated microregions in the border-pair sample, we consider the full setof microregions in other states as potential“donor”(control) units and identifythe microregion that is most similar to each treated unit along the seven char-acteristics included in table 7—effectively amounting to a nearest-neighbormatching approach (Neumark, Salas, and Wascher 2014).29In table B5, weshow that our matching approach substantially reduces the differences acrosstreated and control units vis-à-vis the corresponding differences in both the fulland CBMP samples.30Armed with a closely matched control for each treatedmicroregion, we estimate the employment impacts of the minimum wage, fol-lowing equation (4). We present the estimated results in table B6. The esti-mated impacts of a wage/uniFB02oor increase on the distribution of wages in the res-taurant and accommodation industry are remarkably similar to the resultspresented in tables 5 and 8: a 10% increase in regional wage/uniFB02oor increases sal-aries at the 10th percentile of the wage distribution by 1.7%. Column 4 furthershows that a wage/uniFB02oor increase does not lead to signi/uniFB01cant disemployment im-pacts in this sector. These results/uniFB01t in with the main results presented in thetext and in tables 5–8.Across a variety of samples, control variables, and empirical strategies, wehave so far found that wage/uniFB02oors successfully raised wages at the bottom ofthe wage distribution in Brazil’s restaurant and accommodation sector whileresulting in limited disemployment impacts. While these results could indicatethe existence of a noncompetitive labor market in Brazil’s restaurant and ac-commodation industry (Manning 2003; Giuliano 2013; Azar et al. 2019),arise in a model with search costs where the imposition of a wage/uniFB02oor leads workers in the pairedmicroregion to bargain for higher wages. The wage increase in both microregions may reduce em-ployment, thus muting the disemployment effect from the wage/uniFB02oor.29For each microregion in the CBMP sample, we thus search for the corresponding out-of-statemicroregion that is most similar across these characteristics. We allow for the same microregion tobe selected as a control more than once, and treated microregions may act as“controls”for othertreated microregions if they are most similar across the seven characteristics. Thus, our matchingsample includes 141 unique microregions in Brazil.30This result follows directly from the fact that the matching estimator explicitly aims to reduce thesedifferences.1426ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CULTURAL CHANGE

our results do not imply that the estimated employment elasticities are in factequal to 0. Yet the empirical evidence documented in this section allows us torule out the largest negative employment elasticities previously found in theminimum wage literature (Neumark and Wascher 2008; Neumark, Salas,and Wascher 2014). We thus remark that our results indicate that Brazil’s re-gional wage/uniFB02oors did not result in signi/uniFB01cant employment losses in the restau-rant and accommodation sector.V. ConclusionLatin American countries have an extensive number of regulations in placeaimed at protecting formal sector workers. Chief among them is the minimumwage, which, while varying in size across the region, underwent signi/uniFB01cant in-creases in most countries during the sustained economic expansion of the early2000s. Brazil is a prime example of this trend, with an almost doubling of thereal minimum wage from 2003 through 2012, coupled with the introductionof regional wage/uniFB02oors. In this paper, we have taken advantage of administra-tive data to explore whether the minimum wage or the regional wage/uniFB02oorshave resulted in negative employment effects in the formal sector. Since the in-cidence of the minimum wage varies signi/uniFB01cantly within states, our empiricalanalysis has focused at the microregion level. We fail to/uniFB01nd signi/uniFB01cant disem-ployment impacts from the minimum wage on aggregate formal sector em-ployment. Moreover, we/uniFB01nd larger negative employment elasticities for moreexposed groups—including workers in the restaurant and accommodation in-dustry and high school dropouts, yet the coef/uniFB01cients vary in statistical signi/uniFB01-cance. Finally, in light of Brazil’s commodity-induced economic growth in theearly 2000s, we consider heterogeneous effects of the minimum wage acrossmicroregions differentially exposed to the boom and/uniFB01nd larger negative em-ployment elasticities in less exposed areas. Consequently, we remark on the im-portance of analyzing potential heterogeneity in the impacts of the minimumwage.We have further taken advantage of the introduction of regional wage/uniFB02oorsaimed at employment in speci/uniFB01c industries and occupations. Five states haveintroduced such/uniFB02oors since 2000, and all/uniFB02oors included components directlytargeting employment in the restaurant and accommodation industry. Usingdifferent empirical strategies—including standard minimum wage regressions,a cross-border microregion pair design, and a matching strategy, we have shownthat these/uniFB02oors successfully raised earnings toward the bottom of the wage dis-tribution yet had no associated disemployment impacts. Moreover, we haveshown a lack of spillover effects associated with the introduction of these/uniFB02oors.Saltiel and Urzúa1427

This paper analyzes the role of Uruguay ’s sharp mini-
mum wage increases after 2004 amidst the country ’s
slight wage inequality decrease. We found that the mini-
mum wage increase has contributed to the reduction of
wage inequality for formal workers mainly. However, wealso found a negative impact on employment outside the
capital city, Montevideo, and observed a reduction in
working hours. These results raise doubts about the effec-
tiveness of minimum wage as a redistribution instrument
in developing countries.
1|INTRODUCTION
Wage inequality has long been a matter of governmental concern. One of policy makers ’preferred
tools to alleviate wage inequality is minimum wage legislation, which directly intervenes in the
labor market. The rationale behind such a policy is that a rise in the minimum wage could produce
an increase in the wage of individuals in the lower segment of the earnings distribution and, there-fore, decrease wage inequality.
In addition to affecting wage inequality, minimum wage policy could also affect several labor
market features such as individual wages, employment, worked hours, and informality. In terms of
employment, from a theoretical perspective, in the competitive supply-and-demand model, a mini-
mum wage set above the market-clearing price will lead to an employment reduction (what is usu-
ally called the “employment effects ”of the minimum wage). In contrast, search and matching
models do not predict job losses as a result of a minimum wage increase and, what is more, rent
redistribution occurs in favor of the employee (Mortensen & Pissarides, 1994; Boeri, Helppie &
Macis, 2008). Likewise, in a monopsonistic labor market, a minimum wage increase can create
jobs (Burdett & Mortensen, 1998). Hence, the impact of minimum wage on employment depends
on the model used.
In this context, the potential contribution of the minimum wage policy towards wage inequality
reduction could be affected by the presence of the so-called employment effect. If there are
employment effects of the minimum wage, then the effectiveness of this policy could be reduced
or could even be a counterproductive instrument. Since the theoretical predictions are mixed, theDOI: 10.1111/rode.12326

existence of employment reductions because of the minimum wage is ultimately an empirical
issue.
Therefore, most of the minimum wage literature is devoted to testing the employment effect
hypothesis. Nevertheless, the evidence is not conclusive,1and analysis is required on a case-by-
case basis.
In contrast to the abundance of employment effect literature, less is known about the impact of
minimum wage on wage inequality from a theoretical perspective.2However, from an empirical
perspective, in developed countries, a growing body of research has shown that the effect of mini-
mum wage on wage inequality is not negligible. For instance, Autor, Manning and Smith (2014)
found that the reduction of the minimum wage in the United States has contributed to an increase
in wage inequality.
One exception among developing countries is Brazil, as identified by Neumark Cunningham
and Siga (2006), who found adverse effects of the minimum wage on inequality. In their study,
the treatment variable is the percentage of individuals who three months earlier had wages below
the contemporaneous minimum. One potential shortcoming in their methodology could be related
to the endogeneity of the treatment variable because of the simultaneous determination of wages
and the percentage of individuals below the minimum wage. Furthermore, Bosch and Manacorda
(2010) uses instrumental variables to analyze the contribution of Mexico ’s minimum wage
decrease on its wage dispersion increase. In this context of minimum wage reduction, they found
that minimum wage accounts for a considerable part of the increase in wage inequality.
To add to this body of research, this paper analyzes the impact of Uruguay ’s more than 100%
minimum wage increase on wage inequality. In particular, we study whether the variation in the
minimum wage (or the effective minimum wage) could explain the observed wage inequality pat-
terns in the Uruguayan labor market. In other words, the aim of this paper is to discern whether
there is a causal relationship between minimum wage and wage inequality. Our paper is relevant
because of the scarcity of literature about the impact of minimum wage on wage inequality in
developing countries whose labor markets present a great proportion of adult low-wage workers
compared with developed countries.
Additionally, Uruguay is an interesting case study for the reason that the real minimum wage
more than doubled within a 5-year period. Hence, if there is any effect of minimum wage on
inequality and other labor market outcomes, it is more likely to be visible it in the Uruguayancase. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to analyze the distributive impact of
more than doubling the minimum wage. Moreover, we estimate its impact on employment, hours
of work, wages, and informality.
To do so, we have analyzed the period from 1996 to 2011, a particularly interesting period
because, during the 1990s, the minimum wage policy was not aimed to reduce the observed wage
dispersion, and its value remained almost constant, while after 2004 the minimum wage more than
doubled (26% the yearly growth rate), and earning inequality dropped (around five points of the
Gini index). These movements in minimum wage provide a good identification strategy, which is
based on the variation of the relative minimum wage over time and across regions.
In order to analyze the impact of minimum wage on inequality, we adapted the methodology
proposed by Lee (1999) to the Uruguayan context. Lee developed a model explaining the theoreti-
cal relationship between percentile gaps (for instance, the 10th to 70th percentile gap) across states
and over time as well as the effective minimum wage (minimum wage less the 70th percentile).
From an empirical point of view, the variation of the latter measure across states and over time
enabled him to identify the latent wage inequality that arises after accounting for the effective min-
imum wage. In the case of the United States, there is a national minimum wage, but each state1082|

also sets a minimum wage and, therefore, has the advantage of an additional source of minimum
wage variation. Despite the fact that in Uruguay there is only a national minimum wage, we can
still apply Lee ’s methodology because, as he states on p. 991, fn. 15, “...all the variations in the
effective minimum wage comes from variations in the states ’medians ...”.3Thus, our identifica-
tion strategy is focused on two possible sources of variation: (1) that of the national minimum
wage across time, which experienced great variability in the last twelve years; and (2) the out-
standing variability of percentile gaps among and within regions. The percentile gap variation
among regions emerges from their different living costs.
One important advantage of Lee ’s methodology is that it addresses spillover effects.4This fact
is relevant for two main reasons: (1) some workers ’contracts are set as multiples of the minimum
wage, and (2) in 2005 the sector bargain was reinstated by the government and, hence, the mini-mum wage could be considered as the basis for negotiation. Despite Lee ’s treatment of the
employment effect on the model, one possible limitation of this methodology is its capacity to
account for it. The main problem is that this approach (like others, including DiNardo, Fortin and
Lemieux ’s [1996] decomposition method) is based on observed wages. If we suppose that the
competitive model applies and the minimum wage is set above the equilibrium wage, then some
employees will lose their jobs and, therefore, we will not observe their wages. In this context, what
we observe is, indeed, a rightward shift of the wage density, which could enhance spillover effects,
just as Lee stated.
Providing that during the 1990s in Uruguay, there was no relationship between the minimum
wage
5and the observed wage inequality and, that between 1996 and 2004, this relationship
remained almost constant, we could treat the reintroduction of the minimum wage as a quasi
experiment. We, thereby, exploited the latter jointly with the fact that the minimum wage might
have had a differential effect on wages across regions. In other words, we used the relative mini-
mum wage6to distinguish between the regions that are more sensitive to the reintroduction of a
minimum wage from those in which we could expect a negligible effect. In this context, we used
a difference-in-difference setup as our empirical strategy to assess the impact of the reintroduction
of a minimum wage on employment and other margins of adjustment that could have been affect-
ing the effectiveness of the policy. This idea was borrowed from the U.S. and U.K. literature about
the employment effects of the minimum wage,7in which researchers treated the introduction (or
changes) of the minimum wage as an exogenous source of variation.
To conduct this research, we constructed panel data at the department level using the National
Household Survey from 1996 to 2011, and we focused on males to avoid selection issues. Since
the minimum wage could have had a greater impact on the informal labor market (which is known
as“the lighthouse effect ”),8we applied our empirical strategies to the whole sample, considering
formal and informal workers separately.
First, we estimated Lee ’s model by OLS, as he did in his research paper. As this estimate was
probably biased because of a spurious correlation between the percentile gap and the relative mini-
mum wage, we went one step further, implementing an IV estimation method. In order to do so,
we obtained data of the 1996 to 2011 wage percentiles by department from the social securityrecords. The IV method enabled us to mitigate endogeneity that could arise as a result of simul-
taneity (the division bias problem). In the OLS case, we found that the increase in the minimum
wage contributed to a reduction in wage inequality. Nevertheless, using instrumental variables, we
found that the latter result tended to be smaller. Additionally, we found weak evidence of a nega-
tive impact on employment outside the capital city, Montevideo, and we observed a reduction in
the worked hours.BORRAZ ANDGONZ /C19ALEZ-PAMPILL /C19ON

To present everything in detail, the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we briefly
describe the minimum wage policy and wage inequality trends in Uruguay. Section 3 presents the
methodology applied to disentangle the impact of minimum wage on wage inequality and the
approach to measure its impact on labor market outcomes. In Section 4, we describe the date used
and, in Section 5, we present the results. Finally, Section 6 offers a conclusion.
2|MINIMUM WAGE POLICY AND INEQUALITY IN
URUGUAY
Uruguay introduced a national minimum wage in 1969 in order to establish a wage floor for pri-
vate workers over 18,9with the exception of rural and domestic workers. These sectors have had
specific minimum wages since 1978 and 1990, respectively, and their values were quite similar to
the national one. The government has discretionary authority to set the national minimum wage ’s
value and frequency by means of a decree. The normative wage does not set up any linkage
between their adjustment and the inflation rate. In 1976, Uruguay ratified the International Labor
Organization (ILO) convention about the mechanisms of how to set a minimum wage. This con-
vention set guidelines to determine the value of the minimum wage and encourage the authorities
to take enforcement measures so as to make its policy effective. However, it was not useful in
terms of how to set and adjust the wage ’s amount.
In that sense, despite observing recurrent increments in nominal terms, when considering the
wage ’s evolution in real terms from its introduction until 2004, we observed a downward trend
(Figure 1). In particular, during the 1969 –1995 time frame, the downward trend was more pro-
nounced, while it remained almost constant in the following years until 2004. In general, the
national minimum wage was not being used with a redistributive purpose. In contrast, and mainly
at the beginning of the 1990s, the government used it as a policy instrument to reduce its expendi-
ture, since some social security payments such as income tax, social health insurance, unemploy-
ment insurance and pensions were indexed to the national minimum wage. Moreover, Kristensen
and Cunningham (2006) developed a minimum wage ranking for Latin American countries and
the Caribbean (adjusted by USD PPP) for 1998. Of 19 countries, Uruguay is in the last position of
this ranking. Those latter features could explain the absence of causality between the minimumwage and wage inequality that Gonzalez and Miles (2001) found in their research.

In 2005, the government introduced the Base de Prestaciones y Contribuciones (BPC) to index
social security variables. Therefore, the national minimum wage began to be used as a redistribu-
tive tool. Additionally, the statutory minimum wage has increased dramatically since 2005.
Between 2004 and 2011, the real minimum wage increased almost 200%, in real terms, but it has
not reached the initial level. In Figure 2, we have computed the minimum wage relative to the
mean (and the median), and we have observed that it jumped from 20% in 2004 to around 50% in
the subsequent year. Therefore, after 2004, the national minimum wage was reintroduced as a
redistributive policy and was ultimately an important feature in the labor market.
We should note that in Uruguay the mechanism to set salaries and the minimum wage is inde-
pendent. In practice, during the 1970s, salaries depended on the bargaining between employees
and employers. When democracy was reinstated in 1985, negotiation was conducted by a tripartitebody of members of the state, employers and employees (one possible alternative that is consid-
ered by law), establishing minimum salaries for every sector. In 1991, the government eliminated
the tripartite negotiation. In 2005, the sector bargaining was reinstated by the government.
Wage inequality, however, fluctuated during the 1990s without showing a clear trend. However,
starting in the 2000s, we observed two periods. The first one, which continued to the mid-2000s,
was characterized (as in most Latin American countries) by a trend towards inequality (see the top
panel of Figure 3). Moreover, the bottom panel of Figure 3 shows that the gap between the top
and bottom percentiles grew in this period. In the second period, we observed a considerable
decrease in inequality measures by using the Gini index and the percentile top –bottom percentile
gap. The upward trend tended to reverse, and the wage distribution tended to shrink. However,
when we analyzed the evolution of the percentile gap in the bottom plot for informal workers, we
observed the opposite patterns. That is, the wage distribution tended to shrink during the 2000s,
and, after 2005, tended to present an upward trend. The latter analysis suggests that wage inequal-
ity can evolve differently for informal workers than for formal ones.
During this last period, the minimum wage sharply increased. However, at the same time, other
policies such as conditional cash transfer programs as well as health and tax reforms could poten-
tially explain the change in inequality. Therefore, our research could be considered an assessment
of the isolated contribution of the new minimum wage to wage inequality together with other mar-
ket outcomes. In other words, we investigated the effectiveness of the increase of the minimum
wage as a redistributive tool.

3|EMPIRICAL STRATEGY
3.1 |Impact on inequality (without employment effects)
For the purpose of identifying the effect of the minimum wage on wage distribution, we have fol-
lowed the methodology proposed by Lee (1999). This research is an empirical application of Lee ’s
technical approach, which was implemented for the United States in order to determine the contri-
bution of minimum wage to the increasing wage inequality observed during the 1980s, adapted for
the Uruguayan case. Specifically, Lee takes advantage of the variation in the wage distribution rel-
ative to the minimum wages across states to identify the effect of the minimum wage on latent
wage dispersion —the wage dispersion that would have resulted in the absence of the minimum
wage. Hence, this methodology allows us to answer the following question: how would the wagedispersion evolve once we account for the impact of the minimum wage on the wage distribution?7090110130150170190210230

Despite the fact that Uruguay ’s minimum wage is only set at the national level, the wage distribu-
tion varies greatly throughout the different departments of the country (as we will see later in the
Data section). Then, that enables us to identify the minimum wage effect separately from the
aggregate time effects. Furthermore, while Lee, in his main estimates, uses the federal minimum
wage and not the state ones, all of the sources of variation in his study come from differences in
the wage distribution across states.10Thus, our identification strategy is based on the wage differ-
ential across departments and time. Contrary to the U.S. study, here we are interested in assessing
the reintroduction of the minimum wage on the wage dispersion.
The first step of this methodology is to establish the formal relationship over time and across
departments between the observed wage dispersion measured by the difference between percentiles
of the (log) monthly wage distribution (for instance, the 10th to 70th percentile gap) and the effec-tive minimum wage (following the example, [log] monthly minimum wage —70th percentile). In
addition, we also had to consider the link between the latent wage dispersion and the relative mini-
mum wage. The connection among these three measures depends on the assumption about spil-
lover and disemployment effects. Without considering both of these effects, which is the simplest
scenario, we can model the relationship as follows:

also represents the latent wage inequality in
department iand at time t. Finally, the relative minimum wage is denoted as mw t/C0w70th
it/C0/C1
.A s
the minimum wage only varies across time, it is only indexed with the letter t. This mechanism is
similar to the one observed in a censored model. In the first case, in which the relative minimum
wage is less than the latent wage inequality, the observed percentile gap is equal to the latent wage
inequality. In other words, the relative minimum wage is rather low compared with the latent wage
distribution and, therefore, is not relevant in the determination of wages. This probably occurs in
high-income departments. In contrast, the second line in Equation 1 states that when the latent
wage inequality is less than the relative minimum wage, the observed wage inequality equals the
relative minimum wage. This fact is expected in low-income departments, since we observe a sortof bite in the wage distribution of those departments around the minimum wage, as we will see in
the next section.
When we introduce some refinements to the model and allow the presence of spillover effects,
it is appropriate to change the first line of Equation 1 as follows:
w
pth
it/C0w70th
it¼gm w t/C0w70th
it/C0/C1
ifmw t/C0w70th
it/C0/C1
\wpth
it/C0w70th
it/C16/C170
. In this case, if the first
inequality of Equation 1 holds, the observed wage inequality is an increasing function of the rela-
tive minimum wage, reflecting that the latter affects the wage distribution despite being below the
latent wage inequality, but this effect tends to disappear as the effective minimum wage increases.
In our case, the spillover effects assumption is quite reasonable since, as we mentioned, the mini-
mum wage in some cases is based on contracts and sector bargaining.
Regarding the employment effect, Lee discussed how its presence could affect the model. Since
the analysis was based on observed wages, when a person lost his/her job owing to the employ-
ment effect, we lost an observation, because we did not observe his/her salary anymore. Thus, this
fact could be associated with a shift in the wage percentiles, which could be modeled in a similar
way as spillovers and, therefore, could lead to an “overestimation of true spillover effects. ”In the
most realistic scenario, we might expect the presence of both effects.BORRAZ ANDGONZ /C19ALEZ-PAMPILL /C19ON

Up to this point, the censored model represented in Equation 1 is not yet estimable. It is neces-
sary to determine a parameterization that describes properly the model presented above. Lee
expressed the observed wage inequality as a function of the relative minimum wage and the latent
wage inequality: wpth
it/C0w70th
it/C16/C170
¼fwpth
it/C0w70th
it ;mw t/C0w70th
it/C16/C17
. Thus, our second step is reduced
to parameterizing the latter function, taking into account that there are different ways to do so. In
that sense, we followed Lee (1999) as well as Autor et al. (2014), who stated the following linear
relationship:
wpth
it/C0w70th
it/C16/C17
¼wpth

þbpth

2mw t/C0w70th
it/C0/C1 2þupth
it:
That is, the observed wage gap depends linearly on the latent wage inequality, the relative min-
imum wage, and its square.
One important issue that also needs to be addressed in this approach is the election of the per-
centile of reference so that the first line in Equation 1 holds. In other words, the main identifying
assumption of the model is that the reference wage percentile cannot be affected by the minimum
wage. In the illustration of the model above, we selected the 70th percentile. We chose this per-
centile instead of other wage percentiles based on the following considerations. First, Lee justified
the use of the United State ’s median wage because he found evidence supporting the idea that the
median wage is not affected by the minimum wage. However, as we previously mentioned, the
spillover effects hypothesis probably holds and, therefore, the median wage could not have been
an adequate choice for our empirical application. Hence, as we did not have evidence regarding
this issue, we opted to present our estimates using the 60th, 70th, and 80th percentiles as the refer-
ence wages (which is more similar to the Mexican case [Bosch & Manacorda, 2010]).
Finally, we relaxed Lee ’s assumption, which stated that the latent wage dispersion is equal
across departments, letting the latter vary across departments through the inclusion of department
fixed effects and year effects in the specification. Then, the equation to be estimated can be for-
mally set as follows,

upth
itis a department time-varying error for the pth percentile (distributed independently across
departments and time, and hopefully independently of kpth

i). This regression is structured to
capture the effects of aggregate factors and department-specific responses to aggregate factors. The
parameters of interest are bpth
1andbpth
2, which measure the effect of the relative minimum wage on
the percentile gap ( pth–70th). As we are interested in the marginal effect, we computed
bpth
1þ2bpth
2mw, in which mwis the average of the relative minimum wage. For instance, if p=10,
then the latter formula captures the effect of the relative minimum wage on the percentile gap
w10th
it/C0w70th
it/C0/C1
, and so forth. We estimated Equation 2 for p=10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 90.
The estimation of Equation 2 for the top percentiles (e.g., 80th and 90th percentiles when the refer-
ence wage is the 70th percentile) represents a robustness check, since we do not expect that the
minimum wage has an impact on the upper tail of the wage distribution. If the latter happens, thenour main identifying assumption is being violated. Stated differently, the marginal effect for the
upper percentiles had to be statistically equal to zero for us to be confident about our estimates.1088|

An additional robustness check is the inclusion in Equation 2 of control variables by depart-
ment in order to control by other factors that could affect the percentile gap:11

it;(3)
where x0
itis a vector of control variables that vary across department and over time. Equation 3 is
our parameterization of model (l). Our objective was to mimic Lee ’s censoring model by estimat-
ing these equations and then observing whether predictions can shed light on the contribution of
the minimum wage to wage equality. The model predicts that when mw t/C0w70th
it/C0/C1
increases, the
percentile gap wpth
it/C0w70th
it/C16/C17
will be similar to the former, and when mw t/C0w70th
it/C0/C1
decreases, the
percentile gap wpth
it/C0w70th
it/C16/C17
will approximate to the latent wage inequality. These predictions are
the kind that the model produces.
There are two important assumptions in Lee ’s model. The first one is the independence between
wage levels and wage dispersion by region. The second one is measurement error in variables.
With respect to the first one, Figure 4 shows that the dispersion in the upper part of the wage
distribution does not vary across regions. The different plots show the kernel density of the relative
(log) monthly salary by income region.12We divided the departments according to income into
three groups: (l) high income, which includes the departments of Canelones, Colonia, Maldonado,
Montevideo, Paysand /C19u, and Rocha; (2) medium income, which includes the departments of Dur-
azno, Florida, Salto, San Jose, Soriano, Tacuaremb /C19o, and Treinta y Tres; and (3) low income,
which includes Artigas, R /C19ıo Negro, Cerro Largo, Lavalleja, Rivera, and Flores. To the right of Fig-
ure 4 is the (log) monthly wage relative to the median for the high-income region, and we did not
observe any bite around the minimum wage in either year (apart from informal workers in 2011),
which is not a striking feature in a high-income region labor market. In the medium-incomeregion, a slight bite appears when we consider all workers, but the minimum wage in 2011 is clo-
ser to the mean (and there is a pronounced bite for informal workers). Finally, on the left, we
observe that in 2011 the minimum wage is relevant for the (log) monthly wage and could be
related to a support effect.
The second important assumption of Lee ’s model concerns the estimation that arises from the
possibility of spurious positive correlations between the observed percentile gaps and the effective
minimum wage, which could emerge owing to a sampling error and the fact that the 70th per-
centile is in both sides of Equation 3, which Autor et al. (2014) refer to as the “division bias prob-
lem, ”citing Borjas (1980). It could be that no relationship exists between these measures, but,
because of measurement errors, estimation could incorrectly find a positive and statistically signifi-
cant effect. These sources of bias have to be mitigated in order to avoid misleading estimates. Con-
sequently, attempting to solve this issue, Lee used a trimmed mean, which is the wage mean
excluding the bottom and top 30% of the sample by year and state, to compute the relative mini-
mum wage. One possible drawback of this strategy is arbitrariness in the exclusion of percentages
at the top and bottom. Additionally, as we expect spillover effects, we focus on the 70th percentile
and, thus, we have to impose other criteria of sample exclusion, which will also be arbitrary and
suffer from sampling errors. Moreover, Autor et al. (2014) showed formally that imposing other
criteria does not entirely solve this problem and that this source of bias remains.
Therefore, one possible solution is to estimate Equation 3 using the IV method. Autor et al.
(2014) and Bosch and Manacorda (2010) also addressed the division bias by using IV. In our con-text, the variable to be instrumented is the effective minimum wage, with our instrument being the
effective minimum wage but constructed using the 70th percentile of the wage distribution of the
social security records. That is, the instrument is the same measure, but it comes from otherBORRAZ ANDGONZ /C19ALEZ-PAMPILL /C19ON

sources of information. The intuition here arises from the fact that we do not have arguments to
believe that the sampling error from those different sources of information is correlated. The strat-
egy of using external information to account for measurement error is a common practice when
the data is available. For instance, Card (1996) employed external information to adjust his esti-mates in his research on the effect of unions on wages.
3.2 |Employment effect and other margins of adjustment
As we previously mentioned, Lee ’s methodology does not account for the employment effect (and
other possible effects in related outcomes). Therefore, in order to address this issue, we used an
alternative approach based on the idea that the introduction (or changes) in the minimum wage
provide an exogenous source of variation in the wage distribution across departments. That is, we
used the fact that the minimum wage affects the wage distribution differently across regions (as(a) 1996

we observed in Figure 4). Similarly to the empirical strategy explained above, we used the relative
minimum wage to distinguish regions that are more sensitive to changes in the minimum wage
(for instance, low-income regions) from those in which we could expect a negligible effect (high-
income regions). In this case, the measure of the relative minimum wages was computed as the
average minimum wage after its reintroduction in 2005 minus the pre-2005 average of the 70th
percentile by department. This latter measure, which we labeled as “Intense, ”provided the inten-
sity of the treatment, and it varies at the department level. Once this variable was computed, the
following step was analyzing how employment (and other outcomes such as worked hours, wages,
and informality) varied in regions with different treatment intensity before and after the reintroduc-
tion of the minimum wage. This quasi-experimental approach, usually known in the treatment eval-
uation literature as the difference-in-difference estimator, leads us to the following equation:
yidt¼a0þa1Post tþa2Intense dþa3Post t/C2Intense dþuX0
idtþuidt; (4)
where yidtis the outcome variables (in this case employment, worked hours, log hourly wage, and
informality) for individual i, at department d, and at year t;Post tis a dummy variable that takes
the value of one in the years after the reintroduction of the minimum wage and zero otherwise;
Intense dvaries across departments (as we mentioned earlier, it is useful to distinguish departments
that are sensitive to minimum wage change from those who are not); Post t9Intense dis the inter-
action of the last two variables; X0
idtrepresents the control variables for individual i, at department
d, and at year t; and, finally, uidtis the error term, which varies across individual, department, and
year. Our parameter of interest is a3, and it captures the causal effect of the sharp increase
observed in the minimum wage on several labor market outcomes such as employment.
One of the major concerns of this strategy is the fact that the error term uidtcould be divided
into a component that varies across states and others that vary at the individual level. In order to
consider this error structure in the estimation of the standard error of our main estimator, we
applied the commonly used robust-clustered standard errors at the department level. The problemthat immediately arose is the fact that we have 19 departments, which means a small number of
clusters for making a reliable inference. To mitigate this econometric issue, we used two
approaches that are often used in applied research: (1) the block-bootstrap and (2) the two-step
estimators proposed by Donald and Lang (2007).
Another important concern is that several factors —for example, social policies, the cash transfer
program, and the health and tax reforms that were introduced after 2005 —could have confounded
our estimates. Therefore, we conducted two robustness checks: (1) performing a placebo test,
which entails changing the year of the introduction of the minimum from 2005 to any previous
year (for instance, 2000); (2) estimating Equation 4 for public employees, who are not considered
in the minimum wage policy. If, for this subsample, we found that a
3is statistically different from
zero, our strategy would not have been working properly.
3.3 |Data
In order to undertake this research, we used the yearly Uruguayan National Household Survey(Encuesta Continua de Hogares , ECH) from 1996 to 2011, which is conducted by the National
Statistical Office of Uruguay ( Instituto Nacional de Estad /C19ıstica, INE). We focused on the latter
period for two reasons: (1) data constraints (as we explain below, the data from the social security
records was available only for this period); (2) our focus on the reintroduction of the minimum
wage, which is the main aim of this research.BORRAZ ANDGONZ /C19ALEZ-PAMPILL /C19ON

The ECH has been the main source of socioeconomic information about Uruguayan households
and their members at the national level since 2006, when it started to include rural areas. Prior to
this year, the ECH only covered urban areas of the country. To have a comparable sample
throughout the different years, we defined our sample unit as urban areas of more than 5,000
inhabitants of each department, which represents more than 80% of the total labor force in the
department and, therefore, is representative of the whole work force in each.
Moreover, the selected sample is composed of male wage earners between 14 (the minimum
legal working age) and 60 years old. Despite the fact that the government sets a different monthly
minimum wage for the rural and domestic service sectors, we did not exclude them because: (1)
we only consider urban areas, so there is a negligible proportion of rural workers whose minimum
wage is similar to the national minimum wage and (2) the minimum wage in the domestic servicesector is set just above the national minimum wage, thus not creating an important difference
between the two (see Furtado [2005] for a similar discussion). We excluded the public sector
because the national minimum wage is not relevant for those workers. Finally, we also excluded
the first and the 99th percentiles to avoid outliers.
The ECH has information on the net monthly salaries, social security, and income taxes of each
household member, from which we constructed the monthly salary percentiles by department. We
have 19 departments and a time period of 16 years; hence, as we aggregated the data by depart-
ment, our sample size became 304. Therefore, we refer to our data as a panel at the department
level.
We merged this data with the information about the monthly minimum wage, which is set by
the government and usually changes slightly two times per year, so we took the latest value in
each year.
In Table 1, we present some summative statistics of several variables for the selected sample
period. Between 1996 and 2004, the different percentile salary gaps (e.g., 10th –70th percentile
gap) tended to increase. When we compared 2004 with 2005 (the year in which the minimum
wage was reintroduced), we observed a decline in the salary gaps. By the end of the analyzed per-
iod, apart from the 10th to 70th percentile gap, they continued to decrease.
Figure 5 presents the evolution of the 10th, 20th, 80th, and 90th percentiles relative to the
70th throughout the 1996 to 2011 period, which arises from a regression of each percentile gap
(which varies across department and time) on department and year dummies weighted by the num-ber of observations in each department. As we observed in the lower plot, the ninth percentile
increased to a peak in 2002, and then it fluctuated until 2005, after which it declined, increasing
again during the last year of the period. A similar but more attenuated pattern was followed by
the 80th percentile. Related to the 20th percentile gap, it almost shows an opposite pattern. What
is interesting is that this percentile gap shows an upward trend after the increase of the minimum
wage in 2005.
As for the effective minimum wage, it increased from –1.95 to –1.13 between 1996 and 2011
(see Table 1). We also constructed an additional indicator, the minimum wage average or (median)
monthly wage ratio, in order to explain the rise in the minimum wage related to the average andmedian wage. These ratios increased throughout the period. Specifically, between 1996 and 2011,
the ratio almost doubled when we considered the average wage and increased by 50% when exam-
ining the median wage (see Figure 2). Despite the remarkable rise in the minimum wage, it is still
far from the median as well as from the mean. For instance, in 1998, Paraguay and Colombia had
a ratio of just over 0.70 and 0.50, respectively, as Kristensen and Cunningham (2006) observed.
They also found that in 1998 the Uruguayan minimum wage was one of the lowest in the region.
Based on these facts, one can argue that there is no employment effect of the minimum wage as a1092|

result of a minimum wage increase or, if there is, it probably is negligible. However, we have
tested this hypothesis.
Another interesting labor market feature, which emerged from our observation of Table 1, is
that the percentage of workers below the minimum wage grew sharply from 1% to 5%. This fact
could be related to compliance and enforcement issues. A different explanation is that in develop-ing countries the informal labor market represents around one fourth of the total labor market.
Nevertheless, Maloney and Nu ~nez (2004) as well as Kristensen and Cunningham (2006) noted that
for many Latin American nations the minimum wage has a potential impact on both the formal (or
covered) sector and the informal (or noncovered) sector. Moreover, they argued that the minimum
wage seems to have a stronger effect on the latter than on the former sector. This phenomenon,
usually called the “lighthouse effect, ”occurs when minimum wage is relevant for the informal sec-
tor (where minimum wage law does not apply). Additionally, Khamis (2009) found that the mini-
mum wage has stronger effects on the informal labor market in which workers experience more
considerable wage increases than on the formal labor market.(a) 10th-70th & 20th-70th

In this research, we defined an informal worker as a person who has paid work but has no
access to social security. Under this definition, the proportion of informal workers decreased from
36% in 1996 to 18% in 2011. We also observed that our sample is composed mainly of full-time
workers. Below the minimum wage, the proportion of full-time workers decreases, as is commonly
expected. Neumark (2008) stated that when analyzing data from developing countries “enforcement
of and compliance with minimum wage laws is often erratic. ”
Finally, we observed that the average age in our sample is approximately 35 and that the aver-
age education level increased by one year during the 1996 to 2011 period.
As we mentioned earlier, we also used social security data obtained from the Social Security
Office ( Banco de Previsi /C19on Social , BPS). BPS is a state office in charge of pensions, social bene-
fits, employment insurance, and social security tax collection. Employers are responsible for pay-ing the social security tax, which is calculated using the nominal salary. As a result, the BPS has
the salary records of employees from the entire formal labor market. The office provided us with a
panel set that includes the percentiles by department for the years between 1996 and 2011. In
Table 1, we also present statistics of the percentile salary gaps in the social security records. Using
the BPS data, overall, we observed the same pattern as when using the ECH data. Finally, we also
observed that our instrument —that is, the effective minimum wage constructed using the 70th per-
centile of the social security records —increased until 2005 and fell afterwards.
4|RESULTS
4.1 |Wage inequality
Table 2 and Figure 6 present our OLS estimates of Equations 2 and 3 (which correspond to col-
umns 1 and 2, respectively), in addition to adding time trend effects by department (column 3) for
the different percentile gaps using the ECH data. For the different percentiles of reference, we founda statistically significant effect of the relative minimum wage on the 10th percentile through the
60th percentile of the wage distribution. From the visual inspection of Figure 6, we also observed
that this positive effect declined through the wage distribution, primarily when we considered higher
percentiles. This result suggests the presence of spillover effects. In other words, the impact of the
minimum wage extended to almost the 60th percentile. Interestingly, we did not find statistically
significant effects for the top percentile gaps (80th and 90th) as we had expected from the model.
Another striking point is that the coefficient increased in magnitude for all the percentiles when we
considered a general trend and controlled variables by city in column (3) of each percentile of refer-
ence. As previously indicated, these results could be spurious because of the division bias problem.
In Table 3 (Figure 7), we present the estimates of the impact of the relative minimum wage on
wage inequality using instrumental variables.
13First, in this case, the results are sensitive to the elec-
tion of the percentile of reference and to the specification of the equation. In terms of the latter, when
we consider the full sample without controls and with controls, we found no significant effect at the
1% level (in most of the cases) when we set the reference wage as the 60th or 70th percentile. How-
ever, when we included control variables and a department trend, the effect became significant except
for the 10th percentile gap in column (3). This gap can be explained by noncompliance with the mini-
mum wage law. It is important to note that our instrument is highly correlated with the endogenous
variable (the effective minimum wage), as we can see in the weak identification test of Kleibergen –
Paap presented in Table 3.14Moreover, we included the pvalue of the instrumental variable of the
first stage regression. When considering the 80th percentile as a reference percentile, the picture chan-ged. In the latter case, we observed that the relative minimum wage contributed to the reduction of1096|

the wage gap up to the 70th percentile (columns 1 and 2) and up to the 50th percentile when we used
controls and time trends by department. Not finding significant coefficients above the 70th percentileprovides evidence for the strategy of identification used.
Figure 7 reaffirms what we observed in Table 3. That is, the estimated coefficient was around
zero not only when we did not take into account the control variables but also when we included
it and used the 60th and the 70th percentiles as the reference ones, while we found evidence of a
slight effect when including time trends by department. Finally, for the plots at the bottom, those
for which the 80th percentile was the reference variable, we observed some statistically significant
effects after the 10th percentile, which decreased until it vanished around the 60th.
In Tables A1 and A2 (see the Appendix), we show the estimations for formal and informal
workers separately. In the estimation using only formal males, we found a similar situation. Never-
theless, there is clearer evidence of the impact of the minimum wage on the lower tail of the earn-
ing distributions. That is, when looking at the different specifications and considering differentpercentiles of reference, we observed that the minimum wage contributed towards a reduction in

the wage inequality mainly in the lower tail of the wage distribution. As for spillover effects, the
evidence is mixed. That is, for some specifications, the minimum wage had an impact on the 10th
percentile through the 60th percentile.
To put these findings in perspective, multiplying the implied change in the minimum wage rela-
tive to the 7th decile between the beginning and the end of the period from Table 1 ( +0.61) by the
IV estimate for the most saturated specification in Table 3 (and for pth=70th), row 1, column (6)
(+0.563), this gives an effect of the minimum wage in the ratio between the bottom decile and the
seventh decile of around 34 log points over 16 years, which seems to be a sizeable effect. Follow-
ing the previous calculation but only considering formal workers (Table A1, row 1, and column
6), the results leads to a greater reduction, 44 log points over 16 years.
In contrast, the effect of the relative minimum wage on wage inequality tended to disappear for
the case of informal workers. In this last case, we seem to have weak identification problems. To
overcome this problem, we estimated models (1) and (2) using the limited information maximum like-

using a weak instrument. In addition, as in the presence of weak instrument, we tended to under-reject
the null hypothesis of absence of effect; we also applied the Anderson –Rubin test to perform a robust
inference (the results are not shown but are available upon request). The results do not change.
For Figure 8, we graphed the IV estimates of model (2) for the 10th percentile gap (taking the
80th percentile as the reference one) and for all males in 1996 and in 2011, which are weighted
by the number of observations by department. For 1996, we observed a flat relationship between
the 10th relative percentile and the relative minimum wage, as was expected, since the minimum
wage has been reaching its lower level ever since. Despite the fact that the minimum wage
increased considerably in 2011, there was not a clear positive slope in our estimates. However, the
2011 estimates were closer to the 45 °line. A problem could have arisen because of the absence of
a linear relationship between the percentile gap and the effective minimum wage, which couldhave biased our estimates. Lee also included the square of the effective minimum wage. In our
case, we also included a quadratic term, but it was not statistically significant.
4.2 |Labor market outcomes
Following a difference-in-difference approach, as explained above, we have shown in Table 4 the esti-
mation of the impact of the minimum wage on employment, worked hours, wages, and informality.
Our coefficient of interest was the one associated with the interaction of the “Post ”and the “Intense
pth,”which is labeled as “Post9Intense pth.”We followed a similar strategy as above and then con-
structed the variable intensity using different percentiles of reference in order to check the robustness
of our results. Using the full sample, we did not observe any impact on employment. That is, our
results suggest that there is no employment effect. However, we estimated a negative impact of worked
hours (a reduction of around –4.0 hours at the 1% level), a positive one on wages (an increment in 0.2
in logs at the 1% level), and a reduction of informality (of around 6% and at the 5% level).15We also
conducted the same regression analysis but added control variables (the results are not presented here)
such as years of education, age squared, marriage indicator, children indicator, dummies to control for
industry effects, and if attending an educational institution. The results did not change.
We also estimated the impact of the minimum wage without considering Montevideo, the capi-
tal city in which half of the country ’s population resides. In this case, we observed a negative
impact on employment (at just over 10% at the 5% level), on worked hours (around 7 hours at the

5% level), and a positive effect on wages (0.2 in logs and at the 1% level). We did not observe an
effect concerning informality. These results were in line with the fact that wages were lower and
informality was greater when we did not include the capital city. Interestingly, when considering
only informal workers the coefficients were higher in absolute values than before.16
In order to check the robustness, we considered alternative approaches related to the inferences
applied in this analysis. For Table A4 (see the Appendix), we first used the Donald and Lang
methodology to make inferences in the context of a small number of clusters. We only used this
technique for the sample not including the capital city, because this method requires a similar num-
ber of observations in each of the clusters (and Montevideo has a greater size in terms of observa-
tions compared with the other departments). In this case, we found very slight evidence of
employment effects at the 10% level; hence, the effect of the minimum wage on employmentseemed to vanish. As for the other variables, the results did not change. Additionally, we used a
block bootstrap approach as an alternative to the prior inference method. In this case, we also did
not find employment effects. In addition, the negative effect of the minimum wage on worked
hours was statistically significant at the 10% level and only in one case (that is, using the 60th per-
centile as the reference wage). Results concerning to wages remained unchanged.
Finally, we performed two placebo tests to be sure that we were estimating the impact of the
minimum wage on income inequality. First, we performed a placebo test, which entailed changing
the year of the introduction of the minimum wage from 2005 to a previous year (2000); second,
we estimated Equation 4 only for public employees who are not covered under the minimum wagepolicy. Because we did not find coefficients statistically different from zero, our strategy was
working properly.

5|CONCLUSIONS
Our empirical application aimed to shed light on the contribution of Uruguay ’s sharp minimum
wage increase on the country ’s slight decline in wage inequality. We isolated the impact of the
minimum wage on wage inequality for other social policies that potentially could have impacted
our findings. To estimate the impact of the minimum wage on inequality, we used data from the
urban areas of Uruguay between 1996 and 2011. To handle the joint determination of wages andthe minimum wages, we estimated the model using an instrumental variable estimation strategy.
We found that the minimum wage increase had a significant impact on wage inequality, but
mainly for formal wage workers. In other words, more than doubling the minimum wage had an
effect on lower-income individuals. Despite the minimum wage being a relevant feature for infor-
mal workers, as we observed using kernel plots, the gap between the top and the bottom percentile
shows that it evolves according to different patterns, just as when we considered the distribution
for the whole sample. A possible explanation for the lack of effect on informal workers could be
related to the low level of compliance (as we observe in Figure 4 a great mass of density falls
below the minimum wage in the case of informal workers in 2011). We also observed a reductionin hours of work for the whole country, which confirmed the hypothesis that the minimum wage
effects operate through other margins of adjustment. Additionally, we found a negative impact on
employment outside the capital city, Montevideo. That is, we observed some slight evidence of
employment effects that is traditionally related to the competitive supply-and-demand model.
Finally, we put these results in the context of some theoretical developments in this field. For
instance, our results are in line with the theoretical prediction of Boeri, Garibaldi and Ribeiro
(2011). That is, we found that wages from informal workers increased and that informality was1104|

reduced, which could be related to the fact that low-skill workers shifted to the formal sector. In
addition, Dickens, Manning, and Butcher (2012) developed a theoretical framework to rationalize
empirically the lack of employment effect together with a significant reduction of wage inequality,
which they observed in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our findings can be considered
to be in line with the latter theoretical development; however, it is important to note that first,
despite finding slight employment effects, the minimum wage could affect other relevant variables
such as worked hours (as we observed); second, in developing countries where there are dual labor
markets, the minimum wage policy also affects the reallocation of human resources between the
formal and the informal sectors; finally, despite our results suggesting an effect of the minimum
wage on wage inequality, minimum wage does not seems to be a relevant instrument for address-
ing wage inequality reduction in the informal sector. The latter features also have to be integratedinto a theoretical framework and, therefore, further research.
Ultimately, these results raise doubts about the effectiveness of minimum wage as a redistribu-
tion instrument in developing countries.

ENDNOTES
1The literature on developed countries has focused mostly on the employment effect of minimum wage (e.g., Card
& Krueger, 1994; Dickens & Manning, 2002; Manning, 2003; Addison, Blackburn, & Cotti, 2008). The results aremixed. For some Latin American countries, the literature on this subject also pays more attention to the employmenteffect and is also quite mixed. For instance, Fajnzylber (2001) found a negative employment effect of the minimumwage in Brazil for the period 1982 to 1997. Furthermore, the effect was higher for informal workers than for formalones. However, Lemos (2004) noticed “small adverse effects on employment ”in Brazil between 1982 and 2000.
Neumark et al. (2006), for Brazil between 1996 and 2001, found negative employment effects for the householdhead but positive effects for other family members. In contrast, Lemos (2009) did not discover any evidence ofemployment effects in the formal and informal sectors. Bell (1997) as well as Maloney and Nu ~nez (2004) discerned
negative employment effects in Colombia. Interestingly, in Chile between 1960 and 1998, Montenegro and Pages
(2004) found negative employment effects for young and unskilled workers, but positive effects for women.
2One notable exception is Dickens, Mannning, and Butcher (2012), who developed a model in which minimum
wage has an impact on wage inequality.
3Lee’s (1999) main estimates were based on the federal minimum wage without accounting for its variation across
states. In addition, during the 1980s, each state ’s minimum wage was similar to the federal minimum wage, so
there is not a great amount of variation in this source.
4Flinn and Mabli (2008) provided a theoretical basis for the presence of spillover effects of the minimum wage.
5Gonzalez and Miles (2001) analyzed the effect of a 56% decrease in real terms of the minimum wage (4.7% of theyearly average) in the wage structure between 1986 and 1997. Following a nonparametric quantile regressionapproach, they concluded that the decline in the minimum wage did not explain the increase in wage inequality. Fur-thermore, they observed an upward movement of the lower conditional quantile, which implied a negative linkbetween the lower tail of the distribution and the minimum wage. Therefore, for this period, there was no relation-ship between the minimum wage and the wage structure.
6In this case, the relative minimum wage refers to the national minimum wage after its dramatic increase relative toa wage percentile (for instance, the 70th percentile) before the reintroduction of the minimum wage.BORRAZ ANDGONZ /C19ALEZ-PAMPILL /C19ON

8Maloney and Nu ~nez (2004) analyzed the empirical density of wages for informal workers and observed that in
many Latin American countries there seems to be a spike surrounding the minimum wage. Moreover, Boeri et al.(2011), using a matching model, discovered, after a drastic minimum wage increase, an informal sector increasebecause of a “significant sorting and composition effect ”between the formal and uncovered sectors. Finally, some
empirical studies that applied a difference-in-difference approach found that in developing countries the informal
sector is more sensitive to minimum wage changes (Dinkelman et al., 2012; Khamis, 2013).
9In 1975, a minimum wage was established for workers under 18; its value was set at 75% of the national one, but
it was only in force until 1985.
10Lee (1999, p. 1000, Table I, Panel A). In addition, during the 1980s, the federal minimum wage and the stateminimum wages were nearly similar in each state, as shown in Appendix 3 of Lee ’s research.
11Additionally, we also included department-specific time trends to allow departments to follow different trends
owing to other factors that are unrelated to the effective minimum wage.
12We used the Epanechnikov kernel function and the Sheather –Jones (SJ) plug-in bandwidth. Our concern here was
to detect if the minimum wage represented a feature in the labor market, which is why we chose the SJ plug-in.DiNardo et al. (1996) used it to estimate the actual and counterfactual (log) wage density.
13As mentioned above, the estimations were conducted using yearly data. Additionally, we estimated Equations 2and 3 using quarterly data. The results went in the same direction, but in this case the effect appeared to be statis-tically significant in both cases with and without control variables by city and general trends. Nevertheless, it is
necessary to highlight that when using quarterly panel data, additional issues such as seasonality arise. What is
more, the measurement error problem tends to increase.
14The Kleibergen –Paap test of weak identification is commonly used when the assumption of i.i.d. errors is no
longer valid, as in our case. In addition, we used the practical rule that the Kleibergen –Paap statistic should be
above 10 in order not to have weak identification problems.
15We also estimated this equation with the Donald and Lang (2007) two-step estimator and the bootstrap estimatefor standard errors. The results are similar, and they are available from the authors upon request.

Abstract
This paper studies the extent to which the cyclicality of occupational mobility shapes
that of aggregate unemployment and its duration distribution. We document the relation
between workers’ occupational mobility and unemployment duration over the long run
and business cycle. To interpret this evidence, we develop a multi-sector business cycle
model with heterogenous agents. The model is quantitatively consistent with several
important features of the US labor market: procyclical gross and countercyclical net oc-
cupational mobility, the large volatility of unemployment and the cyclical properties of
the unemployment duration distribution, among many others. Our analysis shows that
occupational mobility due to workers’ changing career prospects, and not occupation-
wide differences, interacts with aggregate conditions to drive the ﬂuctuations of the un-
employment duration distribution and the aggregate unemployment rate.

1 Introduction
Occupational mobility is an important part of unemployed workers’ job ﬁnding pro-
cess. On average 44% of workers who went through a spell of unemployment in the
US changed “major occupational groups” (MOGs) at re-employment.1These occu-
pation movers also take longer to ﬁnd a job and contribute to the cyclical changes in
long-term unemployment. When in downturns the average unemployment dura-
tion for occupation stayers increases, for occupation movers the increase is around
35% larger. This suggests that the willingness and ability of individuals to move
across different sectors of the economy can have important consequences for aggre-
gate labor market ﬂuctuations. This paper builds on this evidence and studies the
implications of unemployed workers’ occupational mobility for the cyclical behav-
ior of the unemployment duration distribution and the aggregate unemployment
rate.
We propose and quantitatively assess a multi-sector business cycle model in
which the unemployed face search frictions in, and reallocation frictions across, het-
erogeneous occupations. The economy we consider further exhibits idiosyncratic
worker-occupation productivity shocks, orthogonal to occupation-wide productiv-
ities, to capture the evolving career prospects of a worker within an occupation.
Workers accumulate occupation-speciﬁc human capital through learning-by-doing,
but face skill loss during unemployment. Even with this rich level of heterogene-
ity, workers’ job separations and reallocation decisions can be characterised by sim-
ple reservation (idiosyncratic) productivity cutoffs that respond to aggregate and
occupational-wide productivities.
A key success of the framework is that it can generate a wide range of cross-
sectional occupational mobility and unemployment duration patterns, as well as the
observed cyclical ﬂuctuations of aggregate unemployment, its duration distribution
and a strongly downward-sloping Beveridge curve. The cyclical responses of the
model’s aggregate job separation and job ﬁnding rates are also in line with the data
(see Shimer, 2005). In addition, the model generates the observed procyclicality of
1Major occupational groups are broad categories that can be thought of as representing one-digit
occupations. For example, managers, sales, mechanic and repairers, construction/extraction, of-
ﬁce/admin support, elementary trades, etc. The above proportion is obtained after correcting for
measurement error.

gross occupational mobility among the unemployed and the stronger countercycli-
cality of unemployment duration among occupational movers. It also generates the
observed increase in net reallocation of workers across occupations during reces-
sions (see Dvorkin, 2014, Pilossoph, 2014 and Chodorow-Reich and Wieland, 2020).
Our approach provides a novel insight. It is the interaction between workers’
idiosyncratic career productivities and aggregate conditions, and not occupation-
wide differences, that drive cyclical unemployment. The main mechanism is as
follows. The estimation yields within each occupation a job separation cutoff that is
above the reallocation cutoff. This captures that with uncertain career prospects and
costly reallocation, those unemployed with idiosyncratic productivities between the
cutoffs prefer the option of waiting and remaining attached to their pre-separation
occupations instead of reallocating. During recessions the area between these cut-
offs widens endogenously and workers spend a longer period of their jobless spells
waiting even though there are currently no jobs they could ﬁll. The higher option
value of waiting drives up (long-term) unemployment more for occupation movers
than stayers and helps create the observed cyclical ampliﬁcation and persistence in
the aforementioned aggregate labor market variables.
The importance of idiosyncratic career productivities in the model’s mechanism
reﬂects the prominence of excess mobility, i.e. moves that cancel each other out at
the occupation level, in driving key occupation mobility patterns in the data. We
use the observed high propensity to change occupations and its increase with unem-
ployment duration to uncover the stochastic process of idiosyncratic career shocks.
The estimated process then shapes workers’ incentive to wait. This waiting motive
is evidenced by the observation that even after a year in unemployment about 45%
of workers still re-gain employment in their previous occupations. As the incentive
to wait changes over the cycle, the model generates procyclical excess and gross
mobility, inline with the data.
A prominent literature of multi-sector models in the spirit of Lucas and Prescott
(1974) “islands” framework typically emphasises countercyclical net reallocation of
unemployed workers across sectors as the main underlying force behind unemploy-
ment ﬂuctuations (see Lilien, 1982, Rogerson, 1987). Countercyclical unemployment
can arise when in recessions more workers engage in time consuming switches from

hard hit sectors to those which offer relatively higher job ﬁnding prospects. To cap-
ture the role of occupation heterogeneity we use an imperfect directed search ap-
proach to model search across occupations over the business cycle (see also Chere-
mukhin et al. 2020 and Wu, 2020). Nevertheless, as gross ﬂows are an order of mag-
nitude greater than net ﬂows, adding this dimension does not change the impor-
tance of workers’ career shocks over occupation-wide productivities in explaining
labor market ﬂuctuations or the procyclical nature of gross occupational mobility.
This occurs because the option value of waiting remains important within (cycli-
cally) declining and expanding occupations. We show that there is no contradiction
between changing career prospects playing a very important role in shaping cyclical
unemployment, and worker ﬂows through unemployment contributing meaning-
fully to the changing sizes of occupations particularly during recessions.
The empirical study of occupation (or industry) mobility focused exclusively on
workers who went through unemployment has received relatively little attention.
This is in contrast to the larger amount of research investigating occupational mo-
bility among pooled samples of employer movers and stayers (see Kambourov and
Manovskii, 2008, and Moscarini and Thomsson, 2007, among others). There is no
reason, a priori, to conclude that the mobility patterns uncovered by these studies
apply to the unemployed. We use data from the Survey of Income and Programme
Participation (SIPP) between 1983-2014 to document relevant patterns linking indi-
viduals’ occupational mobility with their unemployment duration outcomes. We
use the Panel Survey for Income Dynamics (PSID) and the Current Population Sur-
vey (CPS) to corroborate our results.
We calibrate our model using simulated method of moments. The calibration
ﬁnds that the nature of unemployment changes over the cycle. Rest/wait unem-
ployment becomes relative more prominent in recession and search unemployment
in expansions. Alvarez and Shimer (2011) also study the relative importance of rest
and search unemployment using a multi-sector model, but in an aggregate steady
state. Their analysis implies that transitions between work, rest and search are not
determined. In contrast, the dynamics of workers’ idiosyncratic career shocks in our
framework determines the transitions between employment and the different types
of unemployment. This enables the joint analysis of unemployment duration and

occupational mobility, both in the long-run and over the cycle.
The large and persistent rise in unemployment observed during and in the after-
math of the Great Recession generated a renewed interest in multi-sector business
cycle models as useful frameworks to investigate cyclical unemployment. Like our
paper, Pilossoph (2014) ﬁnds a muted effect of net reallocation on aggregate unem-
ployment. Chodorow-Reich and Wieland (2020) build on this work and ﬁnd that
net reallocation co-moves with unemployment most strongly during the recession-
to-recovery phase of the cycle. In these papers, gross mobility is constant or coun-
tercyclical, which is at odds with the data.2These papers also do not focus on the
relation between individuals’ unemployment duration and their occupational mo-
bility, how this relation changes over the cycle or results in cyclical shifts of the
unemployment duration distribution, where the rise of long-term unemployment is
shared across occupations (see Kroft et al., 2016).3
The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 presents the empirical evi-
dence motivating our paper. Section 3 presents the model and its main implications.
Sections 4 and 5 provide its quantitative analysis. Section 6 concludes. All proofs,
detailed data, quantitative analysis and extensive robustness exercises are relegated
to the online appendix and several additional supplementary appendices.4
2 Occupational Mobility of the Unemployed
Our main statistical analysis is based on the sequence of 1984-2008 SIPP panels,
covering the 1983-2014 period. The sample restricts attention to those workers who
were observed transiting from employment to unemployment and back within a
given panel ( EUE ﬂows), and excludes those in self-employment, the armed forces,
or agricultural occupations.5In our main analysis we consider workers who have
2To the best of our knowledge Dvorkin (2014) is the only one who attempts to reproduce the
procyclicality of gross mobility together with the countercyclicality of net mobility. However, his
calibrated model remains far from the data (see his Table 9).
3Closer to our analysis is Wiczer (2015). An important difference is that in our framework work-
ers take into account the potential recovery of their idiosyncratic productivities when making job
separations and reallocation decisions. This feature is crucial for the cyclical properties of our model.

been unemployed throughout their jobless spells, but show that our results hold
when using mixed unemployment / out-of-labor-force spells. To minimize the ef-
fects of censoring due to the SIPP structure, we consider EUE spells for which re-
employment occurs as from month 16 since the start of the corresponding panel
and impose that workers at the moment of re-employment have at least 14 months
of continuous labor market history within their panel. In Supplementary Appendix
B.7 we provide further details of the data construction and analyse the implications
of these restrictions.
An individual is considered unemployed if he/she has not been working for at
least a month after leaving employment and reported “no job - looking for work or
on layoff”. Since we want to focus on workers who have become unattached from
their previous employers, we consider those who report to be “with a job - on lay-
off”, as employed.6After dropping all observations with imputed occupations, we
compare reported occupations before and after the jobless spell. To capture mean-
ingful career changes we use the 21 “major” occupational groups of the 2000 Census
Occupational Classiﬁcation (2000 SOC) as well as their aggregation into task-based
occupational categories (see Autor et al., 2003). In the SIPP , however, the occupa-
tion information of employer movers is collected under independent interviewing,
which is known to inﬂate the importance of occupational mobility. We address this
issue by developing a novel classiﬁcation error model that corrects for coding errors
in the ﬂows between particular occupations, and thereby capture more accurately
coding errors for those occupations that weigh more among the unemployed.
time. We ﬁnd that 50% of those who transited from self-employment to unemployment in the SIPP
went back to self-employment. This suggests that self-employment begets self-employment, a fea-
ture not captured in our model. On the other hand, 96% of those who transited from paid em-
ployment into unemployment returned to paid employment and are captured in our model. Not
including individuals that at some point during a SIPP panel were self-employed implies dropping
11% of person-month observations from our data.
6Fujita and Moscarini (2017) ﬁnd that the unemployed consist of “temporary laid-off workers”
and “permanent separators”. In the latter group are those who lost their job with no indication of
recall. Similarly, Hornstein (2013) and Ahn and Hamilton (2020) consider two groups among the
unemployed: those with high and those with low job ﬁnding rates. Excluding those “with a job - on
layoff” and those who ﬁnd employment within a month means that our unemployment sample is
close to Fujita and Moscarini’s “permanent separators” and to Hornstein’s and Ahn and Hamilton’s
“low job ﬁnding rate” workers. In Supplementary Appendix B.4.4, we discuss this issue further.

2.1 Correcting for Coding Errors in Occupation Mobility
Suppose that coding errors are made according to a garbling matrix Gof size OxO,
where Odenotes the number of occupational categories. The element gijis the prob-
ability that the true occupation i=1, 2, ..., Ois coded as occupation j=1, 2, ..., O,
such that åO
j=1gij=1. Let Mdenote the matrix that contains workers’ true occu-
pational ﬂows, where element mijis the ﬂow of workers from occupation ito occu-
pation j. Under independent interviewing such a matrix appears as MI=G0MG,
where the pre- and post-multiplication by Gtakes into account that the observed
occupations of origin and destination would be subject to coding error. Knowledge
ofG(and of its invertibility) allows us to de-garble MasG 10MIG 1.
Online Appendix A describes this correction methodology formally. Supple-
mentary Appendix A provides all the proofs and detailed discussion. There we
prove that Gcan be identiﬁed and estimated by making three assumptions. ( A1)
Independent classiﬁcation errors : conditional on the true occupation, the realization of
an occupational code does not depend on workers’ labor market histories, demo-
graphic characteristics or the time it occurred in our sample. ( A2)“Detailed balance”
in miscoding : coding mistakes are symmetric in that the number of workers whose
true occupation igets mistakenly coded as jis the same as the number of workers
whose true occupation jgets mistakenly coded as i. (A3)Strict diagonal dominance :
It is more likely to correctly code occupation ithan to miscode it. In Supplementary
Appendix A we use SIPP , PSID and CPS data to evaluate the plausibility of these
assumptions, investigate the implications of the error correction model and verify
that the resulting patterns hold under alternative correction methods (see also Sup-
plementary Appendix B).
We implement our method using the change from independent to dependent in-
terviewing that occurred between the 1985 and 1986 SIPP panels. This shows that at
re-employment true occupational stayers have on average about a 20% chance of ap-
pearing as occupational movers, based on the 2000 SOC. Further, different occupa-
tions have very different propensities to be miscoded and, given a true occupation,
some mistakes are much more likely than others. This matters for measuring net
mobility (deﬁned below), where we ﬁnd a sizeable relative increase in net mobility
after correction.

Notes: Each mobility-duration proﬁle shows for a given unemployment duration x, the proportion of workers who changed
occupations at re-employment among all workers who had unemployment spells which lasted at least xmonths.
2.2 Gross Occupational Mobility and Unemployment Duration
Figure 1 presents a key empirical pattern for our analysis: the mobility-duration pro-
ﬁle. It shows the degree of attachment workers have to their pre-separation occupa-
tion in relation to their unemployment duration. Each proﬁle shows, for duration x,
the proportion of workers who changed occupations at re-employment among all
workers who had unemployment spells that lasted at least xmonths.
Figure 1a shows that 44.5% of workers who had at least one month in unem-
ployment changed occupation at re-employment, while 54.6% of workers who had
at least 9 months in unemployment changed occupation at re-employment. This
evidence thus shows that gross occupational mobility at re-employment is high and
increases moderately with unemployment duration. The moderate increase implies
that a large proportion of long-term unemployed, over 40%, still return to their
previous occupation at re-employment.7The ﬁgure shows that a similar pattern
arises when using the task-based occupational categories: non-routine cognitive
(NRC), routine cognitive (RC), non-routine manual (NRM )and routine manual
(RM)occupations. Supplementary Appendix B.1 shows this pattern also holds
7Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) compare two measures of year-to-year occupational mobil-
ity of pooled employer movers and stayers using the PSID, one that includes and one that excludes
the unemployed. They ﬁnd that the inclusion of unemployed workers raises the year-to-year oc-
cupational mobility rate by 2.5 percentage points, using a two-digit aggregation. Supplementary
Appendices A and B.5 relate in more detail our analysis to theirs.

when using non-employment spells, simultaneous industry/occupation mobility
or self-reported duration of occupational tenure.
Demographics Supplementary Appendix B.1 shows the same patterns across
gender, education and race groups. The level of gross mobility, however, decreases
substantially with age, from 52.6% when young (20-30yo) to 39.7% when prime-
aged (35-55yo). Figure 1b shows that the proﬁle of prime-aged workers is below
that of the young by about 9-13 percentage points but has a very similar slope. Thus,
prime-aged workers display more attachment to their occupation but lose it in a
similar way with duration as young workers.
Mobility by occupation Figure 2 shows that most occupations share high mo-
bility rates. Occupation igross mobility rate (height of each light-shaded bar) is
deﬁned as EiUE i/EiUE, where the numerator denotes the EUE spells of workers
previously employed in iﬁnding employment in a different occupation and the de-
nominator captures all EUE spells that originate from occupation i.8Occupations
with mobility rates above 40% cover more than 80% of all EUE spells in our data.
Apart from small and specialized occupations (as engineers, architects, and doc-
tors), construction is the only large occupation with a rate of about 25%. Further,
the slope of the mobility-duration proﬁle does not arise because some occupations
with relatively high unemployment durations have particularly high occupational
outﬂows – rather, it appears that the unemployed across all occupations lose their
attachment gradually (see Supplementary Appendix B.1 for details).
2.3 Excess and Net Mobility
To assess the importance of moves that result in certain occupations experiencing
net inﬂows (outﬂows) through unemployment, we divide gross occupational mo-
bility into net and excess mobility. The dark bars in Figure 2 depict the net mobility
rate per occupation, deﬁned as (E iUE i EiUE i)/EiUE, where the numerator de-
notes the difference between gross inﬂows and outﬂows for occupation i. It is evi-
dent that net ﬂows are an order of magnitude smaller than gross ﬂows across almost
all occupations, the main exception being managerial occupations. The average net
8We deﬁne our measures of gross, excess and net occupational mobility based on EUE spells as
the longitudinal dimension of the SIPP implies that a worker may have more than one EUE spell.
We consider each spell separately when constructing these mobility measures.

mobility rate, 0.5 åijE iUE i EiUE ij/EUE (where EUE =åiEiUE) equals 4.3%
(uncorrected for miscoding, 3%).9Figure 2 also shows a clear directional pattern:
net outﬂows from the RM occupations and net inﬂows into the NRM occupations.
Excess mobility is the most important component of occupational mobility, ex-
cept for management. The average excess mobility rate åminfE iUE i,EiUE ig/EUE
implies that 40.1% of all EUE spells represent excess mobility, about 90% of all gross
mobility. In Supplementary Appendix B.2 we show that these results are robust to
alternative occupational classiﬁcations and using non-employment spells.
The increase of occupational mobility with duration documented in Figure 1 is
also driven predominantly by excess mobility. We re-compute the average net and
excess mobility rates deﬁned above on the subset of EUE spells of at least duration
x=1, 2, 3, ..., 12. This shows that the rise of excess mobility with duration does not
support the notion that long-term unemployment is primarily driven by a subset
of occupations in which workers are particularly eager to leave for another set of
occupations with better conditions (see Supplementary Appendix B.2).
9The pre-multiplication by 0.5 reﬂects that each net outﬂow in some occupation is simultane-
ously also counted as a net inﬂow in other occupations. Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) have also
highlighted the small relative importance of net mobility across occupations in pooled samples of
employer mover and stayers.

2.4 Repeat Mobility
The SIPP allows us to investigate the evolution of a worker’s attachment to occu-
pations across multiple unemployment spells. These “repeat mobility” statistics tell
us whether workers who changed (did not change) occupations after an unemploy-
ment spell, will change occupation subsequently after a following unemployment
spell. Here we can also use the G-correction to counteract coding errors in three-
occupation histories (surrounding two unemployment spells).10
We ﬁnd that of all those stayers who became unemployed once again, 63.4%
remain in the same occupation after concluding their second unemployment spell.
This percentage is higher for prime-aged workers, 65.6%, and lower for young work-
ers, 61.7%. However, the loss of occupational attachment itself also persists. Among
workers who re-enter unemployment after changing occupations in the preceding
unemployment spell, 54.4% move again. This is lower for prime-aged workers,
49.1%, and higher for the young, 64.5%. Supplementary Appendix B.5 shows a
similar pattern in the PSID.
2.5 Occupational Mobility of the Unemployed over the Cycle
Unemployed workers’ attachment to their previous occupations changes over the
business cycle. In expansions unemployed workers change occupations more fre-
quently than in recessions. Panel A of Table 1 investigates the cyclicality of oc-
cupational mobility by regressing the (log) gross mobility rate on the (log) unem-
ployment rate. Columns (i) and (ii) relate the HP-ﬁltered quarterly series of the
G-corrected and uncorrected occupational mobility rates obtained from the SIPP to
HP-ﬁltered series of the unemployment rate, with a ﬁltering parameter of 1600. Be-
cause there are proportionally more stayers and hence more spurious mobility in

SIPP 3.5 to 5 years windows and are based on 610 of observations of individuals with multiple spells
across all panels when considering only pure unemployment spells and 1,306 when considering non-
employment spells that include months of unemployment. For further details see Supplementary
Appendix B.7. Note that workers with two consecutive unemployment spells within this window
are not necessarily representative of all unemployed workers, nor of behavior in unemployment
spells that are further apart. Nevertheless, these statistics are valuable and will inform our modelling
choices and quantitative analysis (by indirect inference).

recessions, the G-corrected series yields a somewhat stronger cyclicality than the un-
corrected one. Column (iii) presents the regression results based on (uncorrected)
occupational mobility data from the CPS for the period 1979-2019 (see Supplemen-
tary Appendix B.5). We use the CPS as its quarterly mobility series does not suffer
from gaps. We observe that the uncorrected SIPP and CPS series have nearly the
same degree of procyclicality, suggesting that data gaps do not meaningfully affect
our conclusion.11
Columns (iv)-(vii) present the results of regressing unﬁltered occupational mo-
bility series on the HP-ﬁltered unemployment rate for further robustness. Again,
both SIPP and CPS give a broadly similar procyclicality. The last column adds fur-
ther individual-level controls and shows that these do not meaningfully change our
results. The procyclicality of occupational mobility is thus not the result of a com-
positional shift towards occupations or demographics characteristics that are associ-
ated with higher mobility during an expansion. In Supplementary Appendix B.3 we
provide an extensive set of robustness exercises based on the SIPP , all showing the
procyclicality of gross occupational mobility. Supplementary Appendix B.5 further
11Restricting the CPS series to start after the 1994-redesign does not change our results. See Supple-
mentary Appendix B.5. The SIPP series have data missing due to non-overlapping panels combined
with our sampling restrictions (to avoid censoring issues), as described in Supplementary Appendix
B.7. To deal with these gaps, we use TRAMO-SEATS for interpolation, HP-ﬁlter the series and then
discard all quarters that were interpolated.

shows procyclical occupational mobility using the PSID for the period 1968-1997.
Cyclicality of the mobility-duration proﬁle Figure 3a depicts the cyclical shift
of the mobility-duration proﬁle. It plots the proﬁle separately for those EUE spells
that ended in times of high unemployment and those that ended in times of low un-
employment. Times of high (low) unemployment are deﬁned as periods in which
the de-trended (log) unemployment rate was within the bottom (top) third of the de-
trended (log) unemployment distribution. Occupational mobility at any duration is
lower in recessions, corroborating the procyclicality of gross occupational mobility.
Both in times of high and low unemployment, an increase in unemployment dura-
tion is associated with a moderate loss of attachment to workers’ previous occupa-
tion. Panel B in Table 1 similarly shows the vertical shift of the mobility-duration
proﬁle over the cycle and that this is robust to demographics and (origin) occupation
controls.
The cyclicality of net occupational mobility Figure 3b shows the cyclical behav-
ior of the net mobility rate for each of the task-based categories. The net mobility rate
is computed as (E iUE i EiUE i)/EUE , separately for periods of high and low un-
employment.12Across all task-based categories the net mobility rate increases when
12Differently from Section 2.3 we normalise net ﬂows in each task-based category by the total num-
ber of EUE spells observed in periods of either high or low unemployment. Here we also exclude
managers. Supplementary Appendix B.3 shows that this exclusion implies that RCoccupations are
now experiencing net outﬂows instead of net inﬂows as suggested by Figure 2.
12
----------------------------------------

[Page 14 of 269]
unemployment is high, even though EUE also increases. In particular, RM occupa-
tions increase their net outﬂows in downturns relative to expansions, while NRM
occupations increase their net inﬂows in downturns relative to expansions. The
countercyclicality of net mobility therefore implies that the stronger procyclicality
of excess mobility is the main driver of the procyclical behavior of gross mobility
among unemployed workers.13
Comparing unemployment spells between movers and stayers The mobility-
duration proﬁle implies that occupational movers have on average longer spells
than stayers. From an expansion to a recession, this difference grows from 0.4 to 0.9
months.14This increase does not result from cyclically different demographics of
unemployed movers or because they are more likely to come from (move to) occu-
pations with long unemployment durations in recessions (see Supplementary Ap-
pendix B.4). Although occupational mobility decreases in recessions, the lengthen-
ing of unemployment spells among movers is proportionally stronger. Occupational
movers thus contribute meaningfully to the increase in aggregate unemployment,
and especially to the increase in long-term unemployment.
3 Theoretical Framework
We now develop a theory of occupational mobility of the unemployed to explain
the above empirical patterns and link them to the cyclical behavior of long and short
term unemployment as well as the aggregate unemployment rate.
3.1 Environment
Time is discrete t=0, 1, 2, . . . A mass of inﬁnitely-lived, risk-neutral workers is
distributed over a ﬁnite number of occupations o=1, . . . , O. At any time t, work-
ers within a given occupation can be either employed or unemployed and differ
in two components: an idiosyncratic productivity, zt, and human capital, xt. We
interpret the z-productivity as a “career match” which captures in a reduced form
the changing career prospects workers have in their occupations (see Neal, 1999).
13Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) using PSID data also ﬁnd countercyclical net mobility and
procyclical gross mobility among a pooled sample of employer stayers and movers.
14Averaging all spells in our sample, the difference is 0.7 month. This amount is economically
signiﬁcant, 40% of the difference between the average duration of unemployment spells in periods
of high versus low unemployment.
13
----------------------------------------

[Page 15 of 269]
These z-productivities follow a common and bounded ﬁrst-order stationary Markov
process, with transition law F(zt+1jzt).15Their realizations affect a worker both
in employment and in unemployment and will drive excess occupational mobil-
ity. To capture the different levels of attachment to occupations found across age
groups, workers’ accumulate occupational human capital through a learning-by-
doing process while employed, and are subject to human capital depreciation while
unemployed. Conditional on the worker’s employment status, his human capi-
talxtis assumed to evolve stochastically following a Markov chain with values
xt2fx1, ...,xHg,x1>0 and xH<¥.
Each occupation is subject to occupation-wide productivity shocks. Let po,tde-
note the productivity of occupation oat time tand pt=fpo,tgO
o=1the vector that
contains all occupation productivities at time t. Differences across po,twill drive net
mobility. Business cycle ﬂuctuations occur due to changes in aggregate productiv-
ity,At. We allow the occupation-wide productivity process to depend on At. Both
po,tand Atfollow bounded ﬁrst-order stationary Markov processes.
There is a mass of inﬁnitely-lived risk-neutral ﬁrms distributed across occupa-
tions. All ﬁrms are identical and operate under a constant return to scale technology,
using labor as the only input. Each ﬁrm consists of only one job that can be either va-
cant or ﬁlled. The output of an employed worker characterised by (z,x,o)in period
tis given by the production function y(At,po,t,zt,xt), which is strictly increasing
and continuous in all of its arguments and differentiable in the ﬁrst three.
All agents discount the future at rate b. Workers retire stochastically, receiving
a ﬁxed utility ﬂow normalized to zero. They are replaced by new entrants, unem-
ployed and inexperienced workers with x1that are allocated across occupations fol-
lowing an exogenous distribution y. We rescale bto incorporate this retirement risk.
Match break-up can occur with an exogenous (and constant) probability d, but also
if the worker and ﬁrm decide to do so, and after a retirement shock. Once the match
is broken, the ﬁrm decides to reopen the vacancy and, unless retired, the worker
stays unemployed until the end of the period. An unemployed worker receives b
each period. Wages will be determined below.
15The assumption that the zprocess is common across workers and occupations is motivated by
our evidence showing that the change in occupational mobility with unemployment duration does
not seem to differ across occupations or demographic groups.
14
----------------------------------------

[Page 16 of 269]
To study business cycle behavior in a tractable way, we focus on Block Recur-
sive Equilibria (BRE). In this type of equilibria the value functions and decisions of
workers and ﬁrms only depend on wt=fzt,xt,o,At,ptgand not on the joint pro-
ductivity distribution of unemployed and employed workers over all occupations.
An occupation can be segmented into many labor markets, one for each pair (z,x)
such that workers in different markets do not congest each other in the matching
process. Each of these (z,x)labor market has the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides
(DMP) structure. Each has a constant returns to scale matching function which gov-
erns the meetings of unemployed workers and vacancies within a market. We as-
sume that all these markets have the same random matching technology. Each mar-
ket exhibits free entry of ﬁrms, where posting a vacancy costs kper period. Once
an unemployed worker’s zorxchanges, his relevant labor market changes accord-
ingly.16
Searching across occupations Instead of searching for jobs in their own occu-
pation, unemployed workers can decide to search for jobs in different occupations.
This comes at a per-period cost cand entails re-drawing their z-productivity. Work-
ers rationally expect their initial career match in any occupation to be a draw from
F(.), the ergodic distribution associated with the Markov process F(zt+1jzt). The
i.i.d. nature of the re-draws allows us to capture that some occupational movers
end up changing occupations again after a subsequent jobless spell, as suggested by
the repeat mobility patterns documented earlier.
Differences in poimply that workers are not indifferent from which occupation
the draw of zcomes from. To capture that in the data excess mobility is much larger
than net mobility and hence that workers not always specialise their search in the
occupation with the highest po, we model the choice of occupation following an im-
perfectly directed search approach in the spirit of Fallick (1993). During a period,
workers have a unit of search effort to investigate their employment prospects in the
remaining occupations. They can only receive at most one new draw of zper period
16In Supplementary Appendix C we show that a competitive search model in the spirit of Men-
zio and Shi (2010) endogenously generates this sub-market structure, such that in equilibrium un-
employed workers with current productivities (z,x)decide to participate only in the (z,x)market.
Here we proceed by assuming the sub-market structure from the start in order to reduce unneces-
sary complexity in the analysis. The allocations and equilibrium outcomes are the same under both
approaches.
15
----------------------------------------

[Page 17 of 269]
without recall. A worker must then chose how much effort to allocate to each one
of these occupations to maximise the probability of receiving a z. Let s˜odenote the
search effort devoted to occupation ˜osuch that å˜o2O s˜o=1, where O denotes the
set of remaining occupations. Each s˜omaps into a probability of receiving the new
zfrom occupation ˜o. Conditional on switching from o, this probability is denoted
bya(s˜o;o), where a(.;o)is a continuous, weakly increasing and weakly concave
function of swith a(0;o) =0. The concavity creates a trade-off between concentrat-
ing search effort on desirable occupations and the total probability that the worker
draws some z, given by å˜o2O a(s˜o;o)1. With probability 1  å˜o2O a(s˜o;o)noz
is received and the above process is repeated the following period.
If a zis received, the worker must sit out one period unemployed in the new
occupation ˜obefore deciding whether to sample another zfrom a different occupa-
tion.17If the worker decides to sample once again, the above process is repeated.
However, if the worker decides to accept the z, he starts with human capital x1in
the new occupation. The worker’s zand xthen evolve as described above.
3.2 Agents’ Decisions
The timing of the events is summarised as follows. At the beginning of the period
the new values of A,p,zand xare realised. The period is then subdivided into four
stages: separation, reallocation, search and matching, and production. To reduce
notation complexity, we leave implicit the time subscripts, denoting the following
period with a prime.
Worker’s Problem Consider an unemployed worker currently characterised by
(z,x,o). The value function of this worker at the beginning of the production stage
is given by
WU(w)=b+bEw0
max
r(w0)n
r(w0)R(w0)+(1 r(w0))h
l(q(w0))WE(w0)+(1 l(q(w0)))WU(w0)io
,
(1)
where q(w)denotes the ratio between vacancies and unemployed workers currently
in labor market (z,x)of occupation o, with l(.)the associated job ﬁnding probabil-
17This implies that the worker is forced to move to the new occupation even if the zturns out to be
low enough. To further simplify we also assume that after the worker is in the new occupation, he
can sample z-productivities from previous occupations. This way we avoid carrying around in the
state space the histories of occupations ever visited by a worker.

ity. The value of unemployment consists of the ﬂow beneﬁt of unemployment b,
plus the discounted expected value of being unemployed at the beginning of next
period’s reallocation stage, where r(w)takes the value of one when the worker de-
cides to search across occupations and zero otherwise. The worker’s decision to
reallocate is captured by the choice between the expected net gains from drawing a
new ˜zin another occupation and the expected payoff of remaining in the current oc-
cupation. The latter is given by the expression within the inner squared brackets in
(1). The term R(w)denotes the expected net value of searching across occupations
and is given by
R(w) =max
S(w)
å
˜o2O a(s˜o(w))Zz
zWU(˜z,x1,˜o,A,p)dF(˜z) + ( 1 å

,
(2)
where ˆWU(w) = b+bEw0R(w0),Sdenote a vector of s˜ofor all ˜o2O and the
maximization is subject to s˜o2[0, 1]andå˜o2O s˜o=1. The ﬁrst term denotes
the expected value of drawing a new zand losing any accumulated human capi-
tal, while the second term denotes the value of not obtaining a zand waiting until
the following period to search across occupations once again. The formulation of
ˆWU(w)is helpful as it implies that R(w)andfs˜ogbecome independent of z. It is
through R(w)that expected labor market conditions in other occupations affect the
value of unemployment, and indirectly the value of employment.
Now consider an employed worker currently characterised by (z,x,o). The ex-
pected value of employment at the beginning of the production stage, given wage
w(w), is
WE(w) =w(w) +bEw0h
max
d(w0)f(1 d(w0))WE(w0) +d(w0)WU(w0)gi
. (3)
The second term describes the worker’s option to quit into unemployment in next
period’s separation stage. The job separation decision is summarised in d(w0), such
that it take the value of dwhen WE(w0)WU(w0)and the value of one otherwise.
Firm’s Problem Consider a ﬁrm posting a vacancy in sub-market (z,x)in oc-
cupation oat the start of the search and matching stage. The expected value of a
vacancy solves the entry equation
V(w) = k+q(q(w))J(w), (4)
17
----------------------------------------

[Page 19 of 269]
where q(.)denotes ﬁrms’ probability of ﬁnding an unemployed worker and J(w)
denotes the expected value of a ﬁlled job. Free entry implies that V(w) = 0 for all
those sub-markets that yield a q(w)>0, and V(w)0 for all those sub-markets
that yield a q(w)0. In the former case, the entry condition simpliﬁes (4) to k=
q(q(w))J(w).
Now consider a ﬁrm employing a worker currently characterized by (z,x,o)at
wage w(w). The expected lifetime discounted proﬁt of this ﬁrm at the beginning of
the production stage can be described recursively as
J(w) =y(A,po,z,x) w(w) +bEw0h
max
s(w0)n
(1 s(w0))J(w0) +s(w0)V(w0)oi
, (5)
where s(w0)takes the value of dwhen J(w0)V(w0)and the value of one other-
wise.
Wages We assume that wages are determined by Nash Bargaining. Consider a
ﬁrm-worker match currently characterised by (z,x,o)such that it generates a posi-
tive surplus. Nash Bargaining implies that the wage, w(w), solves
(1 z)
WE(w) WU(w)
=z
J(w) V(w)
, (6)
where z2[0, 1]denotes the worker’s exogenous bargaining power. This guarantees
that separation decisions are jointly efﬁcient, d(w) =s(w).
In what follows we impose a Cobb-Douglas matching function and the Hosios
condition, such that 1  z=h, where hdenotes the elasticity of the job ﬁnding
probability with respect to labor market tightness within sub-market (z,x). In our
framework this will guarantee ﬁrms post the efﬁcient number of vacancies within
sub-markets and the constraint efﬁciency of our decentralized economy (see Sup-
plementary Appendix C).
3.3 Equilibrium and Characterization
In a BRE outcomes can be derived in two steps. Decision rules are ﬁrst solved us-
ing (1)-(5). We then fully describe the dynamics of the workers’ distribution, using
the workers’ ﬂow equations. To prove existence and uniqueness we build on the
proofs of Menzio and Shi (2010) but incorporate the value of reallocation across oc-
cupations and show it preserves the block recursive structure. The formal deﬁnition
of the BRE is relegated to Supplementary Appendix C, where we also present the

derivation of the ﬂow equations and the proofs of all the results of this section.
Existence LetM(w)WE(w) +J(w)denote the joint value of the match. To
prove existence and uniqueness of the BRE we deﬁne an operator Tthat is shown to
mapfM(w),WU(w),R(w)gfrom the appropriate functional space into itself, with
a ﬁxed point that implies a BRE. The key step to proof efﬁciency is to ensure that a
worker’s value of searching across occupations coincides with the planner’s value
of making the worker search across occupations.
Proposition 1. Given F (z0jz)<F(z0j˜z)for all z ,z0when z >˜z: (i) a BRE exists and it is
the unique equilibrium; and (ii) the BRE is constrained efﬁcient.
Characterization The decision to separate from a job and the decision to search
across occupations can be characterised by z-productivity cutoffs, which are them-
selves functions of A,p,oand x. The job separation cutoff function, zs(.)is ob-
tained when the match surplus becomes zero, M(w) WU(w) = 0. In contrast
to Mortensen and Pissarides (1994), zrefers to the worker’s idiosyncratic produc-
tivity in an occupation and not to a match-speciﬁc productivity with a ﬁrm. This
difference implies that when the worker becomes unemployed, his zis not lost or is
reset when re-entering employment in the same occupation. Instead, the worker’s
zcontinuous evolving during the unemployment spell. It is only when the worker
searches across occupations that he can reset his z. This occurs if and only if z<
zr(.), where the reallocation cutoff function zr(.)solves R(w) =WU(w).
The relative position and the slopes of zr(.)and zs(.)are crucial determinants
of the long-run and cyclical outcomes in our model. To show this, we ﬁrst discuss
19
----------------------------------------

[Page 21 of 269]
the implications of their relative position and then those of their slopes. Figure 4a
illustrates the case in which zr>zsfor all A, holding constant p,oand x. Here
having a job makes a crucial difference on whether a worker stays or leaves his
occupation. When an employed worker has a z2[zs,zr), the match surplus is
enough to keep him attached to his occupation. For an unemployed worker with a
zin the same interval, however, the probability of ﬁnding a job is sufﬁciently small
to make searching across occupations the more attractive option, even though this
worker could generate a positive match surplus if he were to become employed
in his pre-separation occupation. For values of z<zs, all workers search across
occupations. For values of zzr, ﬁrms post vacancies and workers remain in their
occupations, ﬂowing between unemployment and employment as in the canonical
DMP model.
Figure 4b instead shows the case in which zs>zrfor all A. Workers who en-
dogenously separate into unemployment, at least initially, do not search across oc-
cupations, while ﬁrms do not create vacancies in sub-markets associated with values
ofz<zs. These two cutoffs create an area of inaction, in which workers become rest
unemployed during the time their zlies in [zr,zs): they face a very low – in the model
(starkly) zero – contemporaneous job ﬁnding probability, but still choose to remain
attached to their occupations. The stochastic nature of the zprocess, however, im-
plies that these workers face a positive expected job ﬁnding probability for the fol-
lowing period. Only after the worker’s zhas declined further, such that z<zr,
the worker searches across occupations. For values of zzs, the associated sub-
markets function as in the DMP model.
An unemployed worker is considered search unemployed during the time in which
hiszzs, as in the associated labor markets ﬁrms are currently posting vacancies.
A worker whose current z<zris considered reallocation unemployed only during
the time in which he is trying to ﬁnd another occupation that offers him a z>zr.
Once he ﬁnds such an occupation, he continues his unemployment spell potentially
with periods in search and rest unemployment, depending on the relative position
ofzsand zrand the initial draw and evolution of his zin such an occupation. The
stochastic nature of the zprocess implies that search, rest and reallocation unem-
ployment are not ﬁxed characteristics, but transient states during an unemployment
20
----------------------------------------

[Page 22 of 269]
spell. Therefore, to be consistent with the analysis of Section 2, an occupational mover
is a worker who left his old occupation, went through a spell of unemployment
(which could encompass all three types of unemployment) and found a job in a
different occupation.
A key decision for an unemployed worker is whether to remain in his occupa-
tion, waiting for his zto improve, or to search across occupations, drawing a new
z. Periods of rest unemployment arise when the option value of waiting in unem-
ployment is sufﬁciently large. However, search frictions imply that there is also an
option value associated with waiting in employment in an existing job match. In
the face of irreversible match destruction, workers remain employed at lower out-
put levels relative to the frictionless case because of potential future improvements
in their z-productivities. This drives the separation cutoff function down. The ten-
sion lies in that these two waiting motives work against each other. Which one
dominates depends on parameter values.
Using a simpliﬁed version of the model without aggregate or occupation-speciﬁc
shocks, we show that the difference zs zrincreases when c,borxincrease (see
Supplementary Appendix C.1). Although it is intuitive that a higher corxreduces
zrby making occupational mobility more costly, they also reduce zsby increasing
the match surplus and making employed workers less likely to separate. We show
that, overall, the ﬁrst effect dominates. A rise in bdecreases zrby lowering the
effective cost of waiting, while decreasing the match surplus by increasing WU(.)
and hence increasing zs, pushing towards rest unemployment. We also show that
a higher degree of persistence in the zprocess decreases zs zras it decreases the
option value of waiting.
Figure 4 shows the case of countercyclical job separation decisions ( ¶zs(.)/¶A<
0) and procyclical occupational mobility decisions ( ¶zr(.)/¶A>0), as suggested by
the data. The relative position of zsand zris an important determinant of the cycli-
cality of occupational mobility decisions. Using a simpliﬁed version of the model
without occupation-speciﬁc shocks, we show that when zs>zrone obtains pro-
cyclical occupational mobility decisions without the need of complementarities in
the production function (see Supplementary Appendix C.1). This arises as with
search frictions wages and job ﬁnding probabilities increase with A, and comple-
21
----------------------------------------

[Page 23 of 269]
ment each other to increase the expected value of occupational mobility (relative
more than in the frictionless case). In addition, the presence of rest unemployment
reduces the opportunity cost of mobility, making the latter less responsive to A.
This occurs as any change in Adoes not immediately affect the utility ﬂow of the
rest unemployed.
The relative position of zsand zralso affects the cyclicality of job separation deci-
sions. When zs zr>0 is sufﬁciently large, job separations decisions mainly reﬂect
whether or not an employed worker should wait unemployed in his current occupa-
tion for potential improvements in his z. As occupational mobility is uncertain and
only a potential future outcome, it is discounted. Thus rest unemployment moder-
ates the feedback of procyclical occupational mobility decisions on the cyclicality of
job separation decisions.
4 Quantitative Analysis
As the relative position and the slope of the zsand zrcutoffs can only be fully de-
termined through quantitative analysis, we now turn to estimate the model and
investigate its resulting cyclical properties.
4.1 Calibration Strategy
We set the model’s period to a week and the discount factor b= (1 d)/(1+r)
is such that the exit probability, d, is chosen to match an average working life of 40
years and ris chosen such that bmatches an annual real interest rate of 4%. We
target data based on major occupational groups and task-based categories as done
in Section 2. Our classiﬁcation error model allows us to easily correct for aggregate
and occupation-speciﬁc levels of miscoding by imposing the G-correction matrix on
simulated worker occupational ﬂows at the required level of aggregation.
Aggregate and occupation productivities The production function is assumed
multiplicative and given by yo=Apoxzfor all o2O, chosen to keep close to a
“Mincerian” formulation. The logarithm of aggregate productivity, ln At, follows an
AR(1) process with persistence and dispersion parameters rAandsA. For a given
occupation o, the logarithm of the occupation-wide productivity is given by ln po,t=
lnpo+eolnAt, where podenotes this occupation’s constant productivity level and
eoits cyclical loading. This formulation implies that different occupations can have
22
----------------------------------------

[Page 24 of 269]
different sensitivities to the aggregate shock and hence different relative attractive-
ness to workers over the business cycle.18We consider occupation-wide produc-
tivity differences at the level of task-based categories, O=fNRC ,RC,NRM ,RMg.
All major occupations within a task-based category o2Othen share the same po,t.
This approach not only simpliﬁes the computational burden by reducing the state
space, but is also consistent with the evidence presented in Figure 2 showing that
within the majority of task-based categories all major occupations’ net ﬂows exhibit
the same sign. To further simplify we normalize the employment weighted average
ofpoand of eoacross o2Oto one.
Worker heterogeneity within occupations The logarithm of the worker’s id-
iosyncratic productivity, ln zt, is also modelled as an AR(1) process with persistence
and dispersion parameters rzandsz. The normalization parameter znorm moves the
entire distribution of z-productivities such that measured economy-wide produc-
tivity averages one. Occupational human capital is parametrized by a three-level
process h=1, 2, 3, where x1=1. Employed workers stochastically increase their
human capital one level after ﬁve years on average. With probability gdthe human
capital of an unemployed worker depreciates one level until it reaches x1.
To allow for differences in the separation rates across young and prime-age work-
ers that are not due to the interaction between zand x, we differentiate the exoge-
nous job separation probability between low (x1)and high human capital (x2,x3)
workers: dLanddH. The matching function within each sub-market (z,x)is given
bym(q) =qh.
Search across occupations The probability that a worker in a major occupation

wants to take into account current occupation-wide productivity differences, he will
choose s˜o6=ao,˜ofor at least some ˜o. The cost of doing so is the possibility of not
receiving a new zat all (i.e. å˜o2Oa(s˜o;o)<1) and paying cagain the following

with the patterns documented in Section 2.20

20Many multi-sector models use the random utility model to drive excess mobility, where ad-
ditive taste shocks are distributed i.i.d Type 1 Extreme Value (see Chodorow-Reich and Wieland,
2020, Wiczer, 2015, Dvorkin, 2014 and Pilossoph, 2014, among others). In the most tractable of such
settings, underlying gross ﬂows are constant at all times (e.g. Chodorow-Reich and Wieland, 2020).
More generally, when the reallocation decision involves max o2OfUo(.) +eog, where Uo(.)is the value
of being in occupation oandeois the taste shock, this imposes a symmetry. All mobile workers who
are considering occupations in set Ohave the same distribution over the destinations in O, indepen-
dently of where they originated. Here we want to explicitly break this symmetry to be consistent
with the bilateral ﬂows of the transition matrix, a feature we can do through ao,˜owithout giving
up on a convenient closed form. Our formulation also decouples the cyclical responsiveness from
the cross-sectional ﬂows, again without giving up on the closed form. In contrast, in the additive
taste shock setting ﬁtting cross-sectional patterns constrains the mobility response to cyclical shifts
inUo(.): both dimensions rely on how differences in Uo(.)translate into differences in the cdf of eo
(or a transformation of the latter).

changes. For this we ﬁrst externally calibrate the initial size distribution to match
the one observed in the SIPP in 1984. This results in setting the employment propor-
tions for NRC ,RC,NRM ,RM to 0.224, 0.292, 0.226 and 0.258, respectively, at the
start of the simulation. This size distribution then changes over time due to unem-
ployed workers’ mobility decisions. Let yodenote the exogenous probability that a
new entrant is allocated to task-based category osuch that åo2Oyo=1. This worker
is then randomly allocated to a major occupation within the drawn task-based cate-
gory at the point of entry, and is allowed to search across occupations to obtain ﬁrst
employment somewhere else.
Simulated method of moments In the above parametrization [c,rz,sz,znorm]
govern occupational mobility due to idiosyncratic reasons (excess mobility); [x2,
x3,gd,dL,dH]govern differences in occupational human capital; [po,eo,ao,˜o,n,yo]for
allo,˜o2fNRC ,RC,NRM ,RMggovern occupational mobility due to occupation-
wide productivity differences (net mobility); and the remainder parameters [k,b,h,
rA,sA]are shared with standard DMP calibrations. All these parameters are esti-
mated by minimising the sum of squared distances between a set of model simu-
lated moments and their data counterparts. For consistent measurement we gener-
ate ‘pseudo-SIPP panels’ within one hundred time-windows each of 30 year length
and follow the same procedures and deﬁnitions to construct the moments in data
and in model simulations.
Figures 5a-5e and Table 2 show the set of moments used to recover these param-
eters as well as the ﬁt of the model. The calibrated model provides a very good
ﬁt to the data across all the targeted dimensions. The mobility-duration proﬁles
and survival functions primarily inform the excess mobility and the human capi-
tal parameters. Employer separations patterns inform the parameters shared with
DMP calibrations, except for the persistence and standard deviation of the aggre-
gate productivity process, rAandsA, which are informed by the corresponding
parameters of the series of output per worker ( outpw ) obtained from the BLS, routpw
andsoutpw , and measured quarterly for the period 1983-2014.21The net mobility
21We cannot set rAandsAdirectly because the composition of the economy changes with the cycle
due to workers’ endogenous separation and reallocation decisions. We measure output in the model
and data on a quarterly basis (aggregating the underlying weekly process in the model). For the
data, we HP-ﬁltered the series of (log) output per worker for the period 1970 to 2016, with a ﬁltering
parameter of 1600. Then, we use the persistence and the variance parameters of this series calculated

patterns inform the occupation-speciﬁc productivities, occupation distribution for
new entrants and the imperfect direct search technology. The latter adds a num-
ber of extra parameters to the estimation, particularly the scale parameters ao,˜o. As
mentioned above these allow us to capture very well the relevant differences ob-
served across occupations. We now present the arguments that justify the choice of
moments, keeping in mind that all parameters need to be estimated jointly.
4.2 Gross occupational mobility and unemployment duration
A worker’s attachment to his pre-separation occupation during an unemployment
spell depends on the properties of the zprocess, the human capital process and
the reallocation cost c. The aggregate and age-group mobility-duration proﬁles de-
picted in Figures 5a and 5b (see also Section 2) play an important role in informing
these parameters.
The aggregate mobility-duration proﬁle contains information about candrz. As
shown in Lemma 1 (see Supplementary Appendix C.1) changes in the overall level
of mobility lead to opposite changes in c. The slope of the proﬁle informs rzpri-
marily through the time it takes unemployed workers to start searching across oc-
cupations. A lower rzincreases the relative number of unemployed workers decid-
ing to reallocate at shorter durations, decreasing the slope of the model’s mobility-
duration proﬁle. Lemma 1, however, also implies that a lower rzreduces overall
mobility (ceteris paribus), creating a tension between candrzsuch that an increase
inrzmust go together with an increase in cto ﬁt the observed mobility-duration
proﬁle as depicted in Figure 5a.
To help identify szwe match instead the mobility-duration proﬁles of young and
prime-aged workers. For given values of x, a larger value of szleads to a smaller
importance of human capital differences relative to zdifferences in workers’ output.
This brings the simulated occupational mobility patterns across age groups closer
together, creating a negative relationship between szand the difference between
the mobility-duration proﬁles of young and prime-aged workers. Figure 5b shows
that the model is able to resolve this tension very well. The model also remains
fully consistent with the much larger contribution of excess mobility relative to net
mobility in accounting for the mobility-duration proﬁle at all durations (see Figure
over the period 1983-2014, which is the period that the SIPP and the BLS series overlap.

The parameters x2and x3are informed by the observed ﬁve and ten-year returns
to occupational experience. As it is difﬁcult to accurately estimate the later with the
SIPP , we use the OLS estimates for 1-digit occupations reported in Kambourov and
Manovskii (2009) from the PSID and estimate the same OLS regression in simulated
data.22
Calibrations with or without occupational human capital depreciation yield very
similar long-run moments (see Online Appendix B.2). This occurs as the grad-
ual loss of occupational attachment with unemployment duration underlying the
mobility-duration proﬁle can be generated by human capital depreciation or the z
process. To differentiate these two forces we use the cyclical shift of the mobility-
duration proﬁle. During recessions longer unemployment spells imply that ex-
pected depreciation is higher, making employed workers more attached to their jobs
22We use the OLS estimates because occupation selection occurs both in the model and in the
data, where selection arises as measured returns are a result of two opposing forces: human capital
acquisition and z-productivity mean reversion.

and unemployed workers less attached to their occupations. At the same time low
aggregate productivity interacted with ztypically makes employed workers less at-
tached to their jobs and unemployed workers more attached to their occupations. To
inform this tension and recover gdwe ﬁt the mobility-duration proﬁle in recessions
and expansions as depicted in Figure 5c.
The unemployment survival function depicted in Figure 5d additionally inform
thezand xprocesses. The extent of duration dependence is linked to the proper-
ties of the zprocess (and the importance of search frictions) through its effect on
the extent of true duration dependence and dynamic selection in our model, where
the latter is driven by worker heterogeneity in xand zat the moment of separa-
tion. We use the cumulative survival rates at intervals of 4 months to reduce the
seam bias found in the SIPP . The model also reproduces well the associated hazard
functions (see Figures 1 and 2, Online Appendix B.1). The model captures that dura-
tion dependence is different across occupational stayers and movers and across age
28
----------------------------------------

[Page 30 of 269]
groups, where duration dependence is stronger among occupational stayers relative
to movers and among young relative to prime-aged workers. Young occupational
stayers have especially high job ﬁnding at low durations, which decrease faster with
duration. In addition, the model replicates the (untargeted) unemployment dura-
tion distribution among all workers and separately by age groups. In particular the
empirical amount of long-term unemployment that occurs in the face of high oc-
cupational mobility (see Table 1, Online Appendix B.1). Finally, we target the ratio
between the average unemployment durations of occupational movers and stayers.
The elasticity of the matching function, h, at the sub-market (z,x)level is ob-
tained by estimating through OLS a log-linear relation between the aggregate job
ﬁnding rate (the proportion of all unemployed workers in the economy who have
a job next month) and aggregate labor market tightness (aggregate vacancies over
aggregate unemployed) across quarters, in simulated data. The estimated elasticity
ˆhis targeted to the standard value of 0.5 and allows us to indirectly infer h.
4.3 Employer separations
A worker’s attachment to employment depends on the size of search frictions. A
higher value of kleads to stronger search frictions through its effect on ﬁrm entry
and labor market tightness. Larger search frictions push down the zscutoff relative
tozr, reducing the extent of endogenous separations.23Therefore to inform k(and
the relative position of zsand zr) we use the proportion of separations observed
within a year of workers leaving unemployment relative to the overall yearly sep-
aration rate (“Rel. separation rate recent hire/all”) and the concentration of unem-
ployment spells over a SIPP panel among the subset of workers who start employed
at the beginning of the panel (“Prob (unemp. within 3yr for empl.)”). The proba-
23Intuitively, note that with zs<zrand a persistent z-process, workers who endogenously sepa-
rate will immediately change occupation (see Figure 4). Since these workers will be above their zr
cutoffs in the new occupation, they face a lower risk of further endogenous separations damping
down this margin. However, with zs>zrworkers who endogenously separate and managed to be-
come re-employed in the same occupation remain close to zs, facing once again a high job separation
probability. Among those who changed occupations, there will still be a mass of workers close to
their zscutoffs who face a high risk of future job separation. This leads to a larger amount of endoge-
nous separations for both stayers and movers. As shown below, in the calibrated model zs>zrand
the hazard rate of job separations among new hires out of unemployment is greater for occupational
stayers, 0.037, than for occupational movers, 0.027, as suggested by the previous arguments. This is
qualitatively consistent with SIPP data, where we ﬁnd a hazard rate among new hires of 0.026 for
stayers and 0.024 for movers.
29
----------------------------------------

[Page 31 of 269]
bility that an occupational stayer becomes an occupational mover in the next unem-
ployment spell (“Repeat mobility”) also informs endogenous separations and how
these relate to occupational mobility. Although not shown here, the model is also
consistent with the probability that an occupational mover remains a mover in the
next unemployment spell, as documented in Section 2.4.
Given the job-ﬁnding moments, the overall job separation rate follows from tar-
geting the average unemployment rate. As we focus on those who held a job pre-
viously, we use the most direct counterpart and construct the unemployment rate
only for those who were employed before and satisﬁed our deﬁnition of unemploy-
ment (see Section 2). Note that this unemployment rate (3.6%) is lower than the BLS
unemployment rate, but we ﬁnd it responsible for more than 0.75 for every one per-
centage point change in the BLS unemployment rate (see Online Appendix B.1 and
Supplementary Appendix B.7 for details), consistent with the results of Hornstein
(2013), Fujita and Moscarini (2017) and Ahn and Hamilton (2020).
The ratio of separation rates between young and prime-aged workers (“Rel. sep-
aration rate young/prime-aged”) as well as their survival functions in Figure 5e in-
form dL,dHand b. The extent of separations for young and prime-aged workers also
informs us about bthrough the positions of the zscutoffs of low and high human
capital workers relative to the average of these workers’ productivities.
4.4 Net occupational mobility
Variation over the business cycle can naturally inform the loading parameters eo. We
target the level of net mobility each task-based category exhibits in recessions and
expansions (“Net mobility o,Recessions and Net mobility o,Expansions ”) as well as
their implied difference (“Net mobility o,Rec-Exp ”). We also regress (for each o) the
completed (log) unemployment durations of those workers whose pre-separation
task-based category was oon the (log) unemployment rate and a time trend, and
target the ratio between the estimated unemployment duration elasticity and the av-
erage elasticity across task-based categories, #UD o,u/#UD avg,u(see Online Appendix
B.1 for details). The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to leave untar-
geted the cyclicality of aggregate unemployment, which we separately evaluate in
Section 5. To inform the values of powe target the average net mobility level of each
o(“Net mobility o,Mean ”).
30
----------------------------------------

[Page 32 of 269]
To recover nwe exploit the observed differences in the cyclicality of inﬂows
across task-based categories. As nincreases, workers should be more sensitive (ce-
teris paribus) to cyclical differences in powhen choosing occupations, making the
inﬂows to occupations with the higher porespond stronger. To capture how cycli-
cally sensitive are the inﬂows we compute, separately for expansions and recessions,
the ratio of inﬂows into task-based category oover the sum of all ﬂows. For each o
we target the difference between the expansion and recession ratios, Dexp rec(inﬂow
o/all ﬂows). To recover ao,˜owe target the observed task-based occupation transition
matrix. To recover yowe use the employment-size distribution of task-based cate-
gories observed in 2014, the end of our sample period. We target the average gross
mobility rate across task-based categories so that the model remains consistent with
gross mobility at this level of aggregation.
4.5 Estimated parameters
Table 3 reports the resulting parameter values implied by the calibration. The es-
timated value of brepresents about 80% of total average output, y. Vacancy cost k
translates to a cost of about 30% of weekly output to ﬁll a job. The elasticity of the
matching function in each sub-market (z,x)within an occupation is estimated to be
h=0.24, about half of bh=0.5 when aggregating all sub-markets across occupa-
tions.24
The actual returns to occupational experience x2and x3are higher than the
OLS returns, because occupational entrants select better z-productivities that typ-
ically mean-revert over time, dampening the average evolution of composite xz-
productivity. The parameter gdimplies that a year in unemployment costs an ex-
perienced worker in expectation about 5% of his productivity. The estimated value
24The difference between handbhis mainly due to the effect of aggregation across sub-markets that
exhibit rest unemployment. Workers in episodes of rest unemployed entail no vacancies, have zero
job ﬁnding rates, do not congest matching in other sub-market, but are included in the aggregate
number of unemployed. Hence they are included in the denominator of the aggregate labor market
tightness and the aggregate job ﬁnding rate. It can be shown that this creates a wedge between
hand ˆh=0.5 that is governed by0.5 h
1 h#ˆq,A=#us/u,A, where #ˆq,Aand#us/u,Adenote the cyclical
elasticity of aggregate labor market tightness, ˆq, and the proportion of search unemployment over
total unemployment, us/u, respectively. Since in the calibrated model both elasticities are positive,
0.5 h
1 hmust also be strictly positive and hence h<bh=0.5. In addition, each sub-market within an
occupation has its own concave matching function and hence aggregating these concave functions
across sub-markets also imply that the calibrated value of hwill further diverge from 0.5.

ofcand the sampling process imply that upon starting a job in a new occupation, a
worker has paid on average a reallocation cost of 15.18 weeks (or about 3.5 months)
of output. This suggests that reallocation frictions are important and add to the
signiﬁcant lose in occupational human capital when changing occupation.25
The zprocess has a broadly similar persistence (at a weekly basis) as the aggre-
gate shock process. Its larger variance implies there is much more dispersion across
workers’ z-productivities than there is across values of A. They are also much more
dispersed than occupation-wide productivities. For example, the max-min ratio of
pois 1.13 (1.09) at the highest (lowest) value of A, where the RM task-based cate-
gory is the most responsive to aggregate shocks and NRM the least. In contrast,
the max-min ratio among z-productivities is 2.20. To gauge whether the dispersion
across z-productivities is reasonable we calculate the implied amount of frictional
wage dispersion using Hornstein et al. (2012) Mm ratio. These authors ﬁnd an Mm
between 1.46 and 1.90 using the PSID, while the estimated z-dispersion yields 1.41.
The estimated value of nimplies that the ability of workers to access job opportu-
nities in other task-based categories plays an important role in shaping the direction
of their search. The estimated values of ao,˜oimply that on average workers in NRC
have a low probability of drawing a new zfrom manual occupations and vice versa;
while workers in NRM and RM occupations mostly draw a new zfrom these same
two categories, although drawing from RCis not uncommon. The value of nalso
implies workers signiﬁcantly adjust their direction of search as a response to cycli-
25The average reallocation cost is computed as the product of cand the number of times workers
sample a new occupation, which is 1.996 times.

observed cyclical changes in the net mobility patterns presented in Section 2 and
Table 2. Taken together, these estimates show a high degree of directedness when
workers search across task-based categories.
5 Cyclical Unemployment Outcomes
We now evaluate the cyclicality of aggregate unemployment and its duration distri-
bution in the model, noting that these were not targeted in the estimation procedure.
Our aim is to evaluate the importance of excess and net mobility in generating these
patterns. We ﬁrst present the implications of the full model as estimated above.
Then we discuss the implications of a re-estimated version where we shut down
the heterogeneity in occupation-wide productivities.26With a slight abuse of ter-
minology, we label this version “excess mobility model” as unemployed workers’
occupational mobility decisions are based solely on the changing nature of their z-
productivities and their interaction with Aand x. Online Appendix B.2 presents the
estimation results of this model.
Aggregate unemployment Table 4 shows the cyclical properties of the aggregate
unemployment, vacancy, job ﬁnding, job separation and gross occupational mobil-
ity rates, computed from the data and the simulations. It shows that the full model
is able to generate a countercyclical unemployment rate, together with a counter-
26In this version the observed net mobility patterns can be imposed exogenously to keep the
model’s gross occupational mobility patterns consistent with the evidence presented in Section 2
and Supplementary Appendix B.

cyclical job separation rate, procyclical job ﬁnding and gross occupational mobility
rates. Table 4 also shows that the cyclical volatilities and persistence of all these rates
are very close to the data.
This aggregate behavior is not driven by a higher cyclicality of young work-
ers’ unemployment rate. In Online Appendix B.1 we show that the responsiveness
of the unemployment rate to aggregate output per worker is slightly stronger for
prime-aged workers than for young workers, leading to a countercyclical ratio of
unemployment rates between young and prime-aged workers. Therefore, in the
model the pool of unemployment shifts towards high human-capital, prime-aged
workers during recessions, a feature noted by Mueller (2017).
The model also generates a strongly negatively-sloped Beveridge curve. The
latter stands in contrast with the canonical DMP model, where it is known that en-
dogenous separations hamper it from achieving a Beveridge curve consistent with
the data. Because all poco-move with Aand the loadings eoonly create relative pro-
ductivity differences, it also stands in contrasts with many multi-sector models that
predict an upward sloping Beveridge curve. In these models unemployment ﬂuc-
tuations arise from the time-consuming reallocation of workers from sectors that
experienced a negative shock to the ones that experienced a positive shock and lead
to more vacancies created in the latter sector (see Chodorow-Reich and Wieland,
2020, for a recent exception).
Unemployment duration distribution Panel A in Table 5 evaluates the ability
of the model to reproduce the shifts in the incomplete unemployment duration dis-
tribution with respect to changes in the unemployment rate. It shows that the shares
of unemployed workers by duration exhibit a very similar degree of responsiveness
with cyclical unemployment as in the data. Crucially the elasticity measure shows
that the model creates a strong response in the shares of unemployment at long
durations. When using the semi-elasticity the model generates a nearly perfect ﬁt.
Thus, in our model as in the data cyclical changes in the aggregate unemployment
rate are driven by particularly strong cyclical changes in long-term unemployment.
An important force behind the increase in long-term unemployment during re-
cessions is the larger increase in the unemployment duration of occupational movers
relative to stayers. Panel B in Table 5 shows the cyclical responses of the average

unemployment duration of movers and stayers using different measures. Along
all of these measures the model’s average unemployment duration of occupational
movers increases more than that of stayers, an increase that is consistent with the
data. Stayers’ durations respond somewhat less relative to the data, between 56%
(relative to log HP-ﬁltered unemployment) and 71% (relative to linearly detrended
unemployment). Relative to the lack of ampliﬁcation in conventional DMP models,
this still constitutes a large response. As in the data, the lengthening of movers’
unemployment duration contributes meaningfully to the increase in long-term un-
employment during recessions.
Figure 6 shows how the untargeted shift in unemployment durations combines
with the targeted shift of the mobility-duration proﬁle. At any percentile of the
unemployment duration distribution, the model generates a drop in occupational
mobility in recessions. By comparing the observations’ x-coordinates, this ﬁgure
also illustrates that the cyclical shift of the model’s duration distribution follows the
data.
Excess vs. net mobility A key insight from Tables 4 and 5 is that the afore-
mentioned cyclical patterns are nearly identical to the ones generated by the excess
mobility model. Online Appendix B.2 shows that this model also ﬁts very well the
economy-wide targets described in Table 2 and the estimated values of the corre-
35
----------------------------------------

[Page 37 of 269]
sponding parameters are nearly identical to those in the full model. We further
show that this conclusion holds when considering non-employment spells. This
comparison demonstrates that allowing workers to chose in which occupations to
search due to difference in pois not the reason why the model is able to replicate the
cyclicality of unemployment or its duration distribution. Instead, it highlights the
importance of workers’ idiosyncratic career shocks and its interaction with A.
The two versions are successful in these dimensions because they yield simi-
lar implications for search, rest and reallocation unemployment. Section 5.1 ﬁrst
demonstrates this claim using the excess mobility model. This shows in more detail
the importance of having a persistent zprocess for the cyclical performance of the
model. Section 5.2 shows that the same forces occur within each o, although modu-
lated by differences in the level and cyclical responsiveness of poacross occupations.
5.1 Main mechanism
As argued in Section 3.3, the relative position and slopes of zsand zrhelp determine
the long-run and cyclical implications of our model.
Relative position of zsand zrFigure 7a depicts the cutoff functions generated
by the excess mobility model calibration as a function Agiven x, where all occu-
pations share the same cutoff functions. It shows that zszrfor nearly all Aand
h=1, 2, 3.27This implies that periods of rest unemployment can occur together
with periods of search and reallocation unemployment within the same unemploy-
ment spell as Aand zevolve. Thus our calibration shows that the option value of
waiting (as opposed to immediate reallocation) is important to explain the data. The
importance of rest unemployment is grounded empirically in the mobility-duration
proﬁle and the unemployment survival functions.
The moderate increase of occupational mobility with unemployment duration
implies that even though overall mobility is high, there is still a sizeable proportion
of unemployed workers that regain employment in their pre-separation occupations
after 12 months. The model rationalizes this feature with a zprocess that, while per-
27As predicted by our theory, workers with higher human capital are less likely to change oc-
cupations relative to those with lower human capital. As zs(.,x3)<zs(.,x1)the average level of
separations is also lower for high human capital workers (noting that dLanddHalso contribute to
this difference). Once separated, high human capital workers spend on average a longer time in
unemployment due to the larger distance between their zsand zrcutoffs.

sistent, has still meaningful uncertainty. An occupational stayer, even after a long
time unemployed, is interpreted as the realization of the worker’s earlier “hope” for
the recovery of his z-productivity.
The presence of rest unemployment also rationalizes the moderate duration de-
pendence observed in our unemployment sample and the relatively stronger du-
ration dependence among occupational stayers. To illustrate this consider a set of
workers with the same xwho just endogenously separated. Given zszrand a per-
sistent zprocess, these workers will be initially close to zs. A small positive shock
would then sufﬁce to move them above zs, while only large negative shocks would
take them below zr. Hence at short durations these workers face relatively high
job ﬁnding rates and, if re-employed, they will be most likely occupational stay-
ers. Those who stayed unemployed for longer would have on average experienced
further negative zshocks and would face a higher probability of crossing zr.
Slope of zsand zrAs discussed in Section 3.3, the presence of rest unemploy-
ment makes it more likely for the model to generate countercyclical job separation
decisions and procyclical occupational mobility decisions. Figures 7a,b shows that
in the calibration this is indeed the case; i.e. ¶zs/¶A<0 and ¶zr/¶A>0 for
each x. This property implies that during recessions there is an increased scope for
episodes of rest unemployment; while in expansions there is an increased scope for
episodes of search unemployment. Figure 7c illustrate this last feature by showing
the proportion of workers facing search, rest or reallocation unemployment for a
given value of A. Although both rest and search unemployment are countercycli-
cal, search unemployment episodes are relatively more common when the economy
37
----------------------------------------

[Page 39 of 269]
moves from mild recessions up to strong expansions. It is only as recessions get
stronger that rest unemployment episodes become more common.
The position and slopes of the cutoffs reveal a cyclical area of inaction, [zr(A;x),
zs(A;x)]for each x. The cyclical change of the areas of inaction is important for it
captures that workers’ option value of waiting unemployed in their pre-separation
occupations is higher in recessions than expansions, and is a key determinant of the
cyclical performance of unemployment and vacancies in our model. The negative
slope of the zscutoffs together with the large mass of workers right above them
(see Figure 7b) imply that a decrease in Aleads to a large increase in the inﬂow of
workers into rest unemployment. The positive slope of the zrcutoffs implies that the
same decrease in Aalso leads to a large decrease in the outﬂow from rest unemploy-
ment via reallocation. These forces signiﬁcantly add to the density of unemployed
workers already “trapped” within these areas (see Figure 7a). Given that no ﬁrm in
an occupation expects to be able to make a proﬁt by hiring these workers, vacancy
creation falls as well. As conditions improve the areas of inaction narrow consider-
ably such that rest unemployed workers are now much more likely to get a zshock
that takes them below zror above zs.28As the surplus from hiring these workers be-
comes positive and higher occupational mobility ﬂows help workers increase their
z-productivities, vacancy creation goes up across all occupations. The strong cycli-
cal responses of rest and search unemployment, reﬂecting the changes in the areas
of inaction, imply that aggregate unemployment also becomes highly responsive to
A.29Online Appendix B.2 shows that these patterns occur across all human capital
levels, explaining why we obtain unemployment, job ﬁnding and separations rates
across age groups with similar cyclical responses.
The widening of the area of inaction during recessions also helps capture the
cyclical behavior of the duration distribution. In recessions, long-term rest unem-
ployed workers typically require a sequence of more and larger good zshocks be-
fore becoming search unemployed in their pre-separation occupation. They would
28In recessions that involve a 5% reduction in Arelative to the mean, workers still face an aver-
age probability of about 25% of transitioning out of rest unemployment within a month; and this
probability sharply increases with A.
29Episodes of reallocation unemployment make a small contribution to the cyclicality of ubecause
they only capture the time spent transiting between occupations, which is about 2 weeks on average,
after which workers continue their jobless spell in episodes of rest or search before ﬁnding a job in a
new occupation.
38
----------------------------------------

[Page 40 of 269]
typically also require a sequence of more and larger bad shocks before deciding to
reallocate. In contrast, for those workers who have just endogenously separated, zs
is the cutoff that weighs most on their future outcomes. For these workers the dis-
tance to the nearest cutoff is therefore not as responsive to Aas it is for the long-term
unemployed. Hence over the cycle we observe that the outﬂow rate of long-term
unemployed workers responds more to changes in Arelative to the outﬂow rate of
shorter-term unemployed workers. This mechanism then translates into a stronger
increase in the share of long-term unemployed in recessions as shown in Table 5,
stronger than the one predicted based on the decline of falone. The widening of
the area of inaction in recessions implies that the expected time spent in rest unem-
ployment increases for (ex-post) occupations stayers as well as for (ex-post) movers,
but more so for the latter. This rationalizes the stronger increase in average unem-
ployment duration among occupational movers relative to stayers during recessions
documented in Section 2.4.
The role of human capital depreciation Online Appendix B.2 shows that hu-
man capital depreciation is important in determining these dynamics as it affects the
cyclical changes in the areas of inaction. As discussed in Section 4.2, without it the
model generates aggregate unemployment, job ﬁnding and occupational mobility
rates that are too volatile. This occurs as a potential loss of xduring unemployment
decreases the option value of waiting in the occupation and ﬂattens the zrcutoff. It
also ﬂattens the zscutoff as it increases the option value of staying employed.
The role of occupational mobility The cyclical sensitivity of the areas of inac-
tion is also tightly linked with the existence of the zrcutoff and the properties of the
zprocess. To show this we re-estimate the model not allowing workers to change
occupations. Online Appendix B.3 shows that this version of our model appears
unable to reconcile the observe cyclical ﬂuctuations of the unemployment duration
distribution with those of the aggregate unemployment rate. This occurs as it cannot
resolve a key trade-off. In the absence of the zrcutoff the estimated zprocess is less
persistent and exhibits a larger standard deviation, which creates enough hetero-
geneity in unemployment durations to allow it to match the empirical unemploy-
ment survival functions. However, this zprocess also increases the heterogeneity
ofzrelative to the cyclical range of A. This makes the zscutoffs less responsive

5.2 Occupation Heterogeneity and Cyclical Unemployment
The same mechanism described above also holds within each task-based category
but its strength varies across these occupational groups. Consequently, unemployed
workers face different unemployment outcomes that depend also on the identity of
the occupation. Both the long-run and cyclical dimensions of occupation-wide pro-
ductivity differences are relevant. To understand the former, column 5 in Table 6
shows the contribution of unemployed occupational switchers in changing the ob-
served sizes of the task-based categories in our calibration. This is compared to the
contribution of the exogenous entry and exit process as captured by dandyo(col-
umn 4 “Entrants”), such that for each task-based category the two values add up to
the change in the employment stock (column 3 - column 1). The calibration shows
that NRM occupations increased in size due to more unemployed workers switch-
ing to these occupations than away from them. In contrast, RM and RCdecrease in
size as more unemployed workers move away from these occupations than to them.
The last two columns of Table 6 show the contribution of mobility through un-
employment separately by periods of high and low unemployment, where we cat-
egorise these periods by comparing the HP-ﬁltered unemployment rate to its me-
dian. We observe that it is during recessions that mobility through unemployment
particularly accelerates the changing size of NRM and RM occupations, represent-
ing about two-thirds and three-quarters of the total contribution of this channel,
respectively. Jaimovich and Siu (2020) already documented the importance of re-

cessions in changing the size of routine occupations. Here we show that the net
mobility patterns described in Section 2 together with the endogenous response in
unemployment yield precisely such a pattern within our model.
Figure 8 illustrates the mechanism. Figure 8a shows the levels and cyclicalities
of the estimated occupation-wide productivities for the range of A. Reﬂecting the
estimated values of eo, it shows that RM and RCoccupations are strongly negatively
affected in recessions, but catch up with the average in expansions. In contrast,
NRM occupations are the least attractive in expansions but become more attractive
in recessions. NRC occupations are consistently above average over the cycle (more
so in expansions).
Figures 8b, 8c, 8e, 8f show that these different cyclical productivities result in dif-
ferent separation and reallocation cutoffs. Although their levels are not that differ-
ent across task-based categories, in RM occupations the separation cutoffs decreases
more steeply, while the reallocation cutoffs are nearly horizontal. In NRM occupa-
tions the separation cutoffs are nearly horizontal and the reallocation cutoffs are
strongly upward-sloping. This implies that in recessions job separations are more
prominent in RM than in NRM occupations.
41
----------------------------------------

[Page 43 of 269]
Despite the differences in slopes, all task-based categories exhibit cutoffs with
thezs>zrproperty. Further, the distance between these cutoffs creates areas of
inaction that increase in recessions and narrow in expansions as described earlier.
Figure 8d shows that as a result rest unemployment episodes are more common than
search unemployment episodes in recessions within each task-based category. As
the economy recovers search unemployment episodes are the most common ones.
The observed countercyclical net mobility patterns then occur for mainly two
reasons: (i) a differential cyclical response in the outﬂows across task-based cate-
gories, such that some task-based categories shed more workers during recessions
relative to the average; and (ii) a differential cyclical response in the inﬂows, such
that those workers who have decided to change occupations choose their destina-
tion task-based category differently in recessions than in expansions. The widening
of the area of inactions as Adecreases implies that overall occupational mobility falls
during recessions in all task-based categories. However, the differential responses
inpoacross the cycle imply that the decrease in outﬂows is stronger in NRM occu-
pations and weaker in RM occupations relative to the average, as observed in the
data. At the same time, Table 2 shows that the model is also able to reproduce the
shift in the inﬂow distribution towards RM and away from NRM occupations that
occurs in recessions.
6 Conclusions
We have argued that workers’ option value of remaining attached to their careers
(occupations) while unemployed is relatively larger in recessions than in expan-
sions. The cyclical variation in this option value creates more wait/rest unemploy-
ment episodes than search unemployment episodes in recessions, and it can jointly
explain many features of cyclical unemployment, its duration distribution and occu-
pational mobility. While idiosyncratic uncertainty regarding a worker’s career is the
main force shaping this option value, the latter is also affected by occupation-wide
differences that create net mobility across occupations. We ﬁnd no tension between
the cyclical behavior of individual unemployment outcomes, procyclical gross occu-
pational mobility and countercyclical net mobility through unemployment, where
EUE transitions play a meaningful role in shaping the changing size of RM,RCand
NRM occupations. The potential responsiveness of this option value (or its relative

ONLINE APPENDIX
A Correcting for Occupational Coding Errors
This Appendix complements Section 2.1 of the paper. Supplementary Appendix A
provides the full version of this appendix. There we provide all results and proofs,
present the estimate of G-correction matrix, show that our method is successful out
of sample, and that it affects differently employer/activity movers and pooled sam-
ples of all workers, also when the same (in)dependent interviewing procedure is ap-
plied to both groups in the survey. We further compare the implied extent of coding
error across different occupation (and industry) categories. We also show that our
correction method implies an average occupational mobility rate at re-employment
that is in line with the one derived from the PSID retrospective occupation-industry
supplementary data ﬁles. Finally, we discuss the plausibility of the assumption used
to recover G. To save space, here we only summarise the main mathematical results.
We use this error correction model to produce the results in the main text and Sup-
plementary Appendix B.
The elements of garbling matrix Gare deﬁned to be the probabilities that an oc-
cupation iis miscoded as an occupation j, for all i,j=1, 2, ..., O. We make three
assumptions that allows us to identify and estimate G. (A1)Independent classiﬁcation
errors : conditional on the true occupation, the realization of the occupational code
is independent of worker history, worker characteristics or time. ( A2)“Detailed bal-
ance” in miscoding :diag(c)Gis symmetric, where cis aOx1 vector that describes the
distribution of workers across occupations and diag(c)is the diagonal matrix of c.
(A3)Strict diagonal dominance :Gis strictly diagonally dominant in that gii>0.5 for
alli=1, 2, ..., O.
To estimate Gwe exploit the change of survey design between the 1985 and 1986
SIPP panels. Until the 1985 panel the SIPP used independent interviewing for all
workers: in each wave all workers were asked to describe their job anew, without
reference to answers given at an earlier date. Subsequently, a coder would consider
that wave’s verbatim descriptions and allocate occupational codes. This practise
is known to generate occupational coding errors. In the 1986 panel, instead, the
practise changed to one of dependent interviewing. Respondents were only asked
46
----------------------------------------

[Page 48 of 269]
“independently” to describe their occupation if they reported a change in employer
or if they reported a change in their main activities without an employer change. If
respondents declared no change in employer andin their main activities, the occu-
pational code assigned to the respondent in the previous wave is carried forward.
To identify Git is important to note that during February 1986 to April 1987,
the 1985 and 1986 panels overlap, representing the same population under different
survey designs. The identiﬁcation theory we develop in the next section refers to
this population. We then show how to consistently estimate Gusing the population
samples.
A.1 Identiﬁcation of the Gmatrix
Consider the population represented by 1985/86 SIPP panels during the overlap-
ping period and divide it into two groups of individuals across consecutive inter-
views by whether or not they changed employer or activity. Label those workers
who stayed with their employers in both interviews and did not change activity as
“employer/activity stayers”. By design this group only contains true occupational
stayers. Similarly, label those workers who changed employers or changed activ-
ity within their employers as “employer/activity changers”. By design this group
contains all true occupational movers and the set of true occupational stayers who
changed employers.
Suppose that we were to subject the employer/activity stayers in this population
to dependent interviewing as applied in the 1986 panel. Let csdenote the Ox1 vec-
tor that describes their true distribution across occupations and let Ms=diag(cs).
LetcD
sdenote the Ox1 vector that describes their observed distribution across occu-
pations under dependent interviewing and let MD
s=diag(cD
s). Note that cD
s=
G0Ms  !1, where  !1describes a vector of ones. Msis pre-multiplied by G0as true oc-
cupations would have been miscoded in the ﬁrst of the two consecutive interviews.
Assumption A2implies that cD
s=diag(cs)G  !1=csand hence MD
s=Ms.
Next suppose that instead we were to subject the employer/activity stayers in
this population to independent interviewing as applied in the 1985 panel. Let MI
s
denote the matrix that contains these workers’ observed occupational transition ﬂows
under independent interviewing. In this case MI
s=G0MsG. Here Msis pre-multiplied
byG0and post-multiplied by Gto take into account that the observed occupations of
47
----------------------------------------

[Page 49 of 269]
origin and destination would be subject to coding error.
LetMmdenote the matrix that contains the true occupational transition ﬂows of
employer/activity changers in this population. The diagonal of Mmdescribes the
distribution of true occupational stayers across occupations among employer/activity
changers. The off-diagonal elements contain the ﬂows of all true occupational movers.
Under independent interviewing MI
m=G0MmG. Once again Mmis pre-multiplied
byG0and post-multiplied by Gas the observed occupations of origin and destination
would be subject to coding error.
Letting MI=MI
m+MI
sdenote the matrix that contains the aggregate occupa-
tional transition ﬂows across two interview dates under independent interviewing,
it follows that MI
s=MI MI
m=G0MsG. By virtue of the symmetry of Msand
assumption A2,MsG=G0Ms0=G0Ms. Substituting back yields MI
s=MsGG. Next
note that MI
s=MsTI
s, where TI
sis the occupational transition probability matrix of
the employer/activity stayers in this population observed under independent inter-
viewing. Substitution yields MsTI
s=MsGG. Multiply both sides by M 1
s, which
exists as long as all the diagonal elements of Msare non-zero, yields the key rela-
tionship we exploit to estimate G,
TI
s=GG. (7)
To use this equation we ﬁrst need to show that it implies a unique solution for
G. Towards this result, we now establish that Gand TI
sare diagonalizable. For the
latter it is useful to interpret the coding error process described above as a Markov
chain such that Gis the one-step probability matrix associated with this process.
Lemma A.1: Assumptions A2 and A3 imply that GandTI
sare diagonalizable.
In general one cannot guarantee the uniqueness, or even existence, of a transition
matrix that is the (nth)root of another transition matrix. Here, however, existence
is obtained by construction: Tsis constructed from G, and in reverse, we can ﬁnd
its roots. The next result shows that Tshas a unique root satisfying assumptions A2
and A3.
Proposition A.1: Gis the unique solution to TI
s=G Gthat satisﬁes assumptions A2 and
A3. It is given by PL0.5P 1, where Lis the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of TI
s,0<
li1, and Pis the orthogonal matrix with the associated (normalized) eigenvectors.
48
----------------------------------------

[Page 50 of 269]
The above results imply that under A2and A3,Gis uniquely identiﬁed from the
transition matrix of true occupational stayers under independent interviewing, TI
s.
A.2 Estimation of G
The next lemma provides an intermediate step towards estimating G. For this pur-
pose let PDT(.)denote the space of transition matrices that are similar, in the matrix
sense, to positive deﬁnite matrices.
Lemma A.2: The function f :PDT(ROO)!PDT(ROO)given by f (T) = T0.5
exists and is continuous with f (TI
s) =Gin the spectral matrix norm.
Let ˆTI
sdenote the sample estimate of TI
sand let ˆGbe estimated by the root
(ˆTI
s)0.52PDT(ROO)such that ˆG= ( ˆTI
s)0.5=ˆPˆL0.5ˆP 1, where ˆLis the diago-
nal matrix with eigenvalues of ˆTI
s, 0<ˆli0.51 and ˆPthe orthogonal matrix with
the associated (normalized) eigenvectors. We then have the following result.
Proposition A.2: Gis consistently estimated from (ˆTI
s)0.52PDT(ROO)such that ˆG=
(ˆTI
s)0.5=ˆPˆL0.5ˆP 1. That is, plim n!¥ˆG=G.
To identify and estimate Gin the SIPP it is not sufﬁcient to directly compare the
aggregate occupational transition ﬂows under independent interviewing with the
aggregate occupational transition ﬂows under dependent interviewing. Let MD=
MI
m+MD
sdenote the matrix that contains the aggregate occupational transition
ﬂows across two interview dates under dependent interviewing for employer/activity
stayers and under independent interviewing for employer/activity movers. Sub-
tracting MI=MI
m+MI
sfrom MDyields MD
s MI
s=Ms G0MsG. Given the
symmetry assumed in A2, the latter expression has 0.5 n(n 1)exogenous variables
on the LHS and 0.5 n(n+1)unknowns (endogenous variables) on the RHS, leaving
G(and Ms) unidentiﬁed.
In addition to MD MI=Ms G0MsGone can use MD=G0MmG+Ms, which
contains the remainder information. When Mmhas mass on its diagonal, however,
this additional system of equations has n2exogenous variables on the LHS and n2
unknowns (arising from Mm) on the RHS. This implies that with the nunknowns
remaining from MD MI=Ms G0MsG, one is still unable to identify Gand Ms.
Corollary A.1: IfMmhas mass on its diagonal, Gcannot be identiﬁed from MIandMD
alone.
49
----------------------------------------

[Page 51 of 269]
The intuition behind this result is that by comparing aggregate occupational
transition ﬂows under dependent and independent interviewing, it is unclear how
many workers are ‘responsible’ for the change in occupational mobility between MD
and MI. Only when the diagonal of Mmcontains exclusively zeros, identiﬁcation
could be resolved and one can recover Ms,Gand Mmas the number of equations
equals the number of unknowns.30An implication of the above corollary is that
interrupted time-series analysis that is based on the difference in occupational mo-
bility at the time of a switch from independent to dependent interviewing, does not
identify the precise extent of the average coding error, but provides a downwards
biased estimate.
To identify G, however, Proposition A.2 implies that one can use the observed
occupational transition ﬂows of a sample of true occupational stayers that are sub-
ject to two rounds of independent interviewing. Some of these workers will appear
as occupational stayers and some of them as occupational movers. Ideally, such a
sample of workers should be isolated directly from the 1985 panel. Unfortunately,
the questions on whether the individual changed activity or employer were only
introduced in the 1986 panel, as a part of the switch to dependent interviewing.
As a result, the 1985 panel by itself does not provide sufﬁcient information to sep-
arate employer/activity stayers from employer/activity movers. Instead we use
1986 panel to estimate ˆMI
m. We can infer MI
sindirectly by subtracting the observed
occupational transition ﬂow matrix ˆMI
min the 1986 panel from the observed occu-
pational transition ﬂow matrix ˆMIin the 1985 panel. This is possible as the 1986
panel refers to the same underlying population as the 1985 panel and separates the
employer/activity changers, who are independently interviewed.
Corollary A.2: ˆGis consistently estimated from ˆTI
swhen the latter is estimated from ˆMI 
ˆMI
m
This result is important to implement our approach. It follows as the population
proportions underlying each cell of ˆMs, the sample estimate of Ms, are consistently
estimated. In turn, the latter follows from the standard central limit theorem for
estimating proportions, which applies to ˆMI,ˆMI
mand its difference. Proposition
A.2 then implies that ˆGis consistently estimated.30However, in the SIPP this case is empirically unreasonable as it requires that all em-
ployer/activity changers be true occupational movers.

B Quantitative Analysis
This Appendix is divided into three parts that complement Sections 4 and 5 of the
paper. The ﬁrst part provides further details of the full model calibration done in
Section 4. The second part presents the calibration results from the “excess mobility
model”, where we analyse its ability to reproduce the long-run and cyclical patterns
of several labor market variables.
B.1 Full Model: Gross and Net Mobility
In the main text we show that the calibrated version of the full model is able to repli-
cate well all the targeted long-run occupational mobility, job separation, job ﬁnding
and unemployment patterns of the US labor market. It does so by generating within
each task-based category periods of search, rest and reallocation unemployment as
A,poand zevolve.
Here we expand on the analysis presented in Sections 4 and 5 along three dimen-
sions. First, we further show the model’s implied unemployment durations by pre-
senting (i) the job ﬁnding rates as a function of duration, (ii) the (incomplete) unem-
ployment duration distribution and (iii) the mobility-duration proﬁle decomposed
by excess and net mobility. Second, we provide further details of the differences be-
tween occupational categories with respect to their relative cyclical unemployment
responses, and the cyclical inﬂow and net ﬂow responses that are used to estimate
occupation-speciﬁc cyclical differences in the model. Third, we present the full cor-
relation tables describing the cyclical performance of the model using the 5Q-MA
smoothed and quarterly HP-ﬁltered measures. We also discuss the cyclicality of an
alternative unemployment measure that includes entrants; show the cyclicality of
the unemployment, job ﬁnding and job separation rates by age groups; and present
the decomposition of search, rest and reallocation unemployment episodes for a
given value of Ain a comparable way to the one derived for the excess mobility
model discussed in Section 5.1 of the main text.
Unemployment duration moments Figure 9 shows the aggregate and age-
speciﬁc unemployment hazard functions, comparing the model to the data. The
observed duration dependence patterns are captured very well, where the young
exhibit stronger negative duration duration dependence than the prime-aged. In

our sample (and in the calibration) the degree of duration dependence in the un-
employment hazard is relatively weak as we have tried to minimise the presence of
unemployed workers who were in temporary layoff and/or returned to their pre-
vious employers (see Supplementary Appendix B.4 for a further discussion of this
issue).
Figure 10 shows the aggregate and age-speciﬁc hazard functions separately for
occupational movers and stayers. The model captures these well, where we ﬁnd a
stronger degree of negative duration dependence among occupational stayers than
occupational movers, particularly among young workers, as in the data.

The unemployment duration distribution is also well matched. Table 7 shows it
reproduces very well both the proportion of short and long durations spells across
the distribution. This ﬁt is achieved when pooling together all workers and when
separating them between young and prime-aged workers. Crucially, the ﬁt of the

duration distribution is not implied by targeting the empirical unemployment sur-
vival functions. The reported duration distribution is constructed by averaging du-
ration distributions across quarters, while the survival functions are derived from
pooling all observations. For example, the observed long-term unemployment in
the pooled survival functions occur mainly in recessions and these observations get
down-weighted when averaging across quarters (instead of counting each observa-
tion equally). Indeed, we show below that matching the survival functions does not
imply also matching the duration distribution.
Supplementary Appendix B (Figures 9 and 10) shows that both excess and net
mobility increase with unemployment duration and that the former is the main
driver of the overall increase in the mobility-duration proﬁle. Figure 11a (below) de-
picts the model’s equivalent decomposition using task-based categories and with-
out considering the “management” occupation. In the model both excess and net
mobility increase with unemployment duration. Given the countercyclicality of net
mobility, the latter occurs as net mobility is more prominent in recessions where
workers’ unemployment durations are typically longer. As in the data, excess mo-
bility is the main driver of the mobility-duration proﬁle.
Task-based occupational categories over the cycle The cyclical productivity
loadings eoare the only four cyclical parameters that explicitly differ across task-
based categories o2 fNRC ,RC,NRM ,RMg. Together with the elasticity of the
cross-occupation search, n, these parameters shape the differential cyclical response
of each category oalong three dimensions, summarised by 12 moments in the main
text. (i) The cyclical response of net mobility for each task-based category, (ii) the
cyclical change in the proportion of occupational movers that choose an occupa-
tion category o, and (iii) the strength of each category’s unemployment durations

response relative to the economy-wide average response to the aggregate unem-
ployment rate.
We highlight that in (iii) we target the unemployment duration elasticities for
each task-based category relative to the economy-wide elasticity. We do this as we
want to leave untargeted the ampliﬁcation of aggregate unemployment. In partic-
ular, as a ﬁrst step to derive these elasticities in the SIPP we regress for each task-
based category othe log unemployment durations of workers who lost their job
inoon the log (aggregate) unemployment rate and a linear trend. Let #UD o,ufor
o2fNRC ,RC,NRM ,RMgdenote the resulting unemployment duration elastici-
ties with respect to aggregate unemployment. The ﬁrst row of Table 8 presents these
elasticities and compares them to the simulated ones in the calibration. These elas-
ticities show that NRM occupations have a more muted cyclical response than RM
occupations. This differential response is also statistically signiﬁcant: a Wald test
on equality of the two corresponding coefﬁcients has an associated p-value of 0.02.
In the second step, we normalize each elasticity by the (occupation size-weighted)
average of all four elasticities. The resulting normalized elasticities are the ones we
target in the model. The last two rows of Table 8 shows these ratios, showing that
the model ﬁts the data well. In particular, it shows that RM occupations are the most
cyclically sensitive in terms of unemployment durations; while NRM occupations
are the least cyclically sensitive. These elasticities are in line with the data. Below
we show that the model is also successful in generating the untargeted aggregate
unemployment ampliﬁcation.
As shown in the main text, the model is consistent with the cyclical changes in
net mobility as well as the cyclical changes in the inﬂows for each task-based cat-
egory. This occurs as differences in eotranslate into cyclically changing incentives

for workers to leave an occupation in category oand, depending on n, to sample
z-productivities from another occupation in category o0. Figure 11b displays the
relationship between these two set of moments. For each task-based category, it
shows the relationship between the cyclical changes in net mobility on the x-axis
(“Net mobility o,Expansions - Net mobility o,Recessions ”) and the cyclical changes
in inﬂows as a proportion of all occupational movers on the y-axis ( Dexp rec(inﬂow
o/all ﬂows)). RM occupations have the strongest cyclical response of net outﬂows,
increasing in recessions, as well as the strongest response in the inﬂow proportion,
also larger in recessions. In contrast, NRM occupations are the ones which expe-
rience the largest increase in net inﬂows in recessions and the largest increase in
inﬂows as destination category.
As Figure 11b and Table 8 show, the model captures well the co-movement along
dimensions (i), (ii) and (iii) discussed above. In particular, with only one set of
parameters indexed by task-based occupation category, eo, the model reproduces
well the average co-movement of the cyclical inﬂow shift with the cyclical changes
in net ﬂows. Figure 11b shows that when comparing the ﬁtted regression lines in
the data and the model both display very similar slopes, where changing the net
ﬂow by 1% goes together with an inﬂow response of more than 2%.
Economy-wide cyclical outcomes In terms of the cyclical properties of the un-
employment, vacancies, job ﬁnding and separation rates, Table 9 show the full set
of correlations for the model and data. The model’s aggregate time series arise from
55
----------------------------------------

[Page 57 of 269]
the distributions of employed and unemployed workers across all labor markets,
combined with agents’ decisions. The top panel compares the data and model us-
ing centered 5Q-MA time series of quarterly data. The cyclical components of the
(log) of these time series are obtained by using an HP ﬁlter with parameter 1600. It
shows that the model matches the data very well. The bottom panel compares the
data and model without using this smoothing procedure. The version now yields
vacancy and job separation rates that are much less persistent than their data coun-
terparts. This happens because we have used a relative coarse grid for the simulated
productivity process, as making the productivity grid ﬁner will make the compu-
tational time of the calibration unmanageable. This implies that the discreteness
of the zsand zrcutoffs functions (relative to the productivity grid) makes the va-
cancy and job separation rates change value too often. Using a centered 5Q-MA on
quarterly data alleviates this feature without further compromising on computation
time. Note, however, that this comes at the cost of reducing the volatility of the va-
cancy rate (and labor market tightness) in the model from 0.07 to 0.05 (0.21 to 0.17),
while in the data they remain stable. Similarly on the data side, the job ﬁnding rate,
measured in a consistent way with the model while taking into account censoring
in the SIPP , is somewhat noisy at quarterly frequency. Smoothing this time-series
using the 5Q-MA helps diminish this noise.
As argued in main text (and in Supplementary Appendix B.7) we consider the
unemployment rate of those workers who are unemployed between jobs (EUE), so
that the occupational mobility of these workers can be straightforwardly measured.
The resulting EUE unemployment rate (EUE /(EUE +E)), under the deﬁnitions
and restrictions we explained in the main text, is signiﬁcantly lower than the BLS at
3.5% (vs 6.3%), but drives much of its changes. In particular, for every one percent-
age point change in the BLS unemployment rate, we ﬁnd that about 0.75 percentage
points originate from the response of the EUE unemployment rate. This means that
the relative cyclical response of the EUE unemployment rate is much stronger than
the relative response of the BLS unemployment rate. Indeed, the volatility of the
HP-ﬁltered logged quarterly EUE unemployment rate is 0.16 while the correspond-
ing BLS unemployment measure (which includes inﬂows from non-participation)
over the same period is 0.11. For the 5Q-MA smoothed time series, the difference

is from 0.15 (EUE)to 0.10 (BLS). The above also means that the focus on EUE un-
employment raises the bar further to achieve sufﬁcient ampliﬁcation. Nevertheless,
Table 9 shows that our model performs well.
In the model we also can calculate a measure of unemployment that includes
unemployment following ﬁrst entry into the labor market. Relative to the BLS mea-
sure, this measure still excludes unemployment associated with workers who re-
enter the labor market during their working life or who subsequently leave the la-
bor force but not before spending time in unemployment. Including entrants in
unemployment raises the average total unemployment rate to 5.2% in the model,
exhibiting a lower volatility of 0.12 (5Q-MA smoothed). The latter arises as with
this unemployment measure, roughly 60% of the way from the EUE to BLS unem-
ployment measures, the volatility gets closer to that of the BLS measure. Cross-
correlation and autocorrelation statistics of this alternative unemployment measure
are very similar to the EUE unemployment measure.
The ability of the model to replicate the cyclical behavior of many labor mar-
ket variables is down to the coexistence of episodes of search, rest and reallocation
unemployment during workers’ jobless spells. Figure 12 shows that when aggregat-
ing across all occupations the distribution of these types of unemployment episodes

across values of Ais very similar to the one generated by the excess mobility model
depicted in the main text. That is, search unemployment episodes are the most
common when the economy moves from mild recessions up to strong expansions.
It is only as recessions get stronger that rest unemployment episodes become more
common.
The middle and right panels of Figure 12 shows that among young and prime-
aged workers the calibration generates similar search and rest unemployment dy-
namics over the business cycle. This yields high and similar cyclical volatilities for
the unemployment, job ﬁnding and separation rates across age groups. In particular,
theuvolatilities for the young and the prime-aged are 0.139 and 0.141, the volatili-
ties of ffor young and prime-aged workers are 0.099 and 0.096; and the volatilities
ofsare 0.059 for young workers and 0.063 for prime-aged workers. We return to
this point in the next section when presenting the calibration details of the excess
mobility model.
B.2 Excess Mobility and Cyclical Unemployment
To show the importance of idiosyncratic occupation-worker ( z) productivity shocks
in allowing the full model to replicate the cyclical behavior of many labor market
variables, we re-estimate the model by shutting down occupation-wide heterogene-
ity (level and business cycle loadings), effectively setting po,t=1 at all t. In this
case, a worker’s productivity at time tin an occupation ois completely described by
aggregate productivity A, worker-occupation match productivity zand occupation-
speciﬁc human capital x. Workers do not (and do not want to) prefer a new occupa-
tion over another before knowing their z. Note that although we label this model as

the “excess mobility model”, it can easily be made consistent with the observed av-
erage net ﬂows by imposing an exogenous transition matrix that governs the prob-
abilities with which a worker in occupation oobserves a zin a different occupation
o0.31This is in contrast to our full model, where occupational productivities po,po0
differ and change relative to one another over the cycle and in response workers
change the direction of their cross-occupation search. As such the full model can
be considered as the “endogenous net mobility” model, while the excess mobility
model as the “exogenous net mobility” model.
B.2.1 Benchmark Excess Mobility Model
This version of the model corresponds to the excess mobility model in the main text.
Except for occupation-wide productivity differences and a cross-occupation search
decisions, everything else remains as described in Section 3 of the main text. We use
the same functional forms as done to calibrate the full model in Section 4 of the main
text. This implies that to capture economic choices and gross mobility outcomes, we
now have a set of 14 parameters to recover, where [c,rz,sz,znorm]governs occu-
pational mobility due to idiosyncratic reasons (excess mobility);

governs differences in occupational human capital; and the remainder parameters
[k,b,h,rA,sA]are shared with standard DMP calibrations. We jointly calibrate these
parameters by matching the moments reported in Table 10 and Figures 13a-13e.
The excess mobility model matches very well the targeted occupational mobility
moments as well as the job ﬁnding and job separation moments. The ﬁt is compa-
rable with the one of the full model. This model also matches well the untargeted
moments pertaining to workers’ gross occupational mobility and job ﬁnding haz-
31With a cyclically varying exogenous transition matrix, we would also be able to match the ob-
served cyclical net ﬂows.

separation rates and labor market tightness as well as the full set of correlations

cyclical implications of the excess mobility model are very similar to that of the full
model, as shown and discussed in the main text.

Age patterns Figure 14 shows that the occurrence of search, rest and realloca-
tion unemployment episodes not only happens when pooling all workers together
but also for each age group, as in the full model. Figure 15 shows these age group
dynamics more clearly by depicting the distribution of unemployed and employed
workers among young and prime-aged workers. It shows that during recessions
unemployment among young workers is concentrated slightly above zs(.,x1)and
61
----------------------------------------

[Page 63 of 269]
between zs(.,x1)and zr(.,x1). During expansions, however, unemployment is lo-
cated above the zs(.,x1)cutoff. In the case of prime-aged workers, the concentration
of unemployment during recessions and expansions occurs mostly above zs(.,x3)
and between zs(.,x3)and zr(.,x3), but also between the zs(.,x1)and zr(.,x1)cutoffs.
This difference implies that during expansion episodes of rest unemployment are
still prevalent among prime-aged workers, while for young workers these episodes
basically disappear (as shown in Figure 14) and are consistent with a lower occupa-
tional mobility rate among prime-aged workers.
As in the full model, the excess mobility calibration obtains a similar cyclical-
ity for the unemployment, job ﬁnding and separations rates across age-groups. In
both models this occurs because the estimated z-productivity process places enough
workers on the zscutoffs across the respective human capital levels. Figure 15
shows that, as is the case for low human capital workers, many high human capital
workers enjoy high z-productivities, but for a number of them their z-productivities
have drifted down, positioning themselves close to zs(.,x3). Some of these high
human capital workers will subsequently leave the occupation, but over time the
stock of workers close to zs(.,x3)will be replenished by those workers who cur-
rently have high z-productivities but will suffer bad z-realizations in the near fu-
ture. As zs(.,x3)<zs(.,x1)the average level of separations is lower for high human
capital workers, but this nevertheless does not preclude the similarity in the afore-
mentioned cyclical responsiveness.
Given that it is clear the excess mobility model is able to replicate on its own
many critical features of the full model, in what follows we use it to perform two
key exercises. The ﬁrst one highlights the effect of human capital depreciation in at-
tenuating the cyclical properties of the above labor market variables and motivates
our use of the cyclical shift of the mobility-duration proﬁle as a target. The second
exercise investigates the quantitative implications of our model when considering
that a worker’s varying job ﬁnding prospects (due to the stochastic nature of the
z-productivity process) during a jobless spell can be linked to observed transitions
between the states of unemployment and non-participation (or marginally attached
to the labor force) as deﬁned in the SIPP . For this exercise we recompute all of the
relevant empirical targets using non-employment spells that contain a mix of pe-

B.2.2 The Importance of Human Capital Depreciation
To estimate the full and the excess mobility models we used the mobility-duration
proﬁles at different durations during recessions and expansions. These patterns in-
formed us about the rate of occupational human capital depreciation during spells
of unemployment. In the main text, we argued that these proﬁles were crucial in
helping us identify the depreciation parameter, gh. The reason for the latter is that
a model which did not incorporate human capital depreciation will generate very
similar long-run moments as a model which did incorporate depreciation, but gen-
erate different cyclical predictions. To show this, we now discuss the result of the
excess mobility model without human capital depreciation. To estimate the latter
we target the same long-run moments as in the calibration described above, but do
not target the cyclical behaviour of the mobility-duration proﬁle.
We ﬁnd that the ﬁt is very good, similar to the models which incorporates human
capital depreciation. It also does well in matching the same untargeted long-run
moments described above. The estimated parameter values are also similar. Further,
this calibration ﬁnds that periods of search, rest and reallocation unemployment can
arise during a worker’s jobless spell across all levels of occupational human capital.

and without occupational human capital depreciation. We plot the mobility-duration
proﬁle in times of expansions and recessions (low and high unemployment, respec-
tively), where Figure 16a shows the mobility-duration proﬁles from the model with
human capital depreciation and Figure 16b shows the ones for the model without
human capital depreciation. The latter ﬁnds that the lack of human capital depreci-
ation implies the model completely misses the proﬁle at nearly all durations during
recessions, particularly at low durations. Is precisely this lack of ﬁt that motivated
us to add the cyclical patterns of the mobility-duration proﬁle as targets in order to
help identify the rate of human capital depreciation.
Table 11 shows the second key difference. The model without depreciation gen-
erates a larger amount of cyclical volatility in the aggregate unemployment, job
ﬁnding and job separation rates in relation to the model with human capital de-
preciation. Relative to the data, Table 9 shows an overshooting in the volatilities of
the unemployment and job ﬁnding rates. This occurs as the area of inaction between
zrand zsbecomes too cyclical. Without human capital depreciation there is a sharp
drop in the proportion of rest unemployment and a sharper rise in the proportions
of search and reallocation unemployment as the economy improves. Human capital
depreciation attenuates these effects, improving the model’s ﬁt.
B.2.3 The Unemployed and Marginally Attached
Previous calibrations build the analysis based on the interpretation that, although
a worker who is currently in rest unemployment cannot ﬁnd a job, he would want
to search for jobs (as opposed to stay idle at home) because he still faces a posi-

tive expected job ﬁnding probability in the near future. Episodes of rest unemploy-
ment, however, could conceptually be extended to incorporate marginally attached
workers. To investigate the latter we expand our analysis to capture more broadly
the occupational mobility decisions of the unemployed and marginally attached in
shaping the cyclicality of aggregate unemployment.
We do this by re-estimating the excess mobility model, recomputing the targets
using non-employment spells in which workers transition between unemployment
and non-participation as labelled in the SIPP . We consider non-employment spells
with at least one period of unemployment, which we label ‘NUN’ spells. To avoid
maternity and related issues in non-participation we restrict the focus to men. We
show that when considering NUN spells the model still reproduces the observed
cyclical ampliﬁcation in the non-employment rate.32
The ﬁt is once again very good in this case even though the survival probability
in NUN spells shifts up signiﬁcantly at longer durations, compared to the corre-
sponding patterns for unemployment spells, both for all workers and across age
groups. The estimated parameter values are also broadly similar to the ones in the
previous versions of the excess mobility model, changing in expected directions.
The zprocess is now somewhat more volatile, but the higher reallocation cost im-
plies that the area of inaction between zsand zris (in relative terms) also larger. The
latter leaves more scope for workers to get “trapped” for longer periods in rest un-
employment episodes, thus creating an increase in the survival functions across all,
young and prime-aged workers as observed in the data.
32Here we also focus on spells of at least one month and workers who say that they are “without a
job”, mirroring these sample restrictions for unemployment spells.
65
----------------------------------------

[Page 67 of 269]
Table 12 shows the main takeaway of this exercise. The model remains able to
generate cyclical movements of the non-employment, job ﬁnding and job separation
rates as well as a relatively strong Beveridge curve. In particular, the cyclical volatil-
ities of the non-employment and job ﬁnding rates are the same as in the data. As
in the previous estimations, here we also ﬁnd that the reason for the ampliﬁcation
of the non-employment rate is that the model generates period of search, rest and
reallocation unemployment, whose relative importance changes over the cycle.
Including marginally attached workers in our analysis increases the overall im-
portance of rest unemployment in normal times. This is consistent with the fact that
in these times the non-employment rate is higher and the associated job ﬁnding rate
lower, compared to our benchmark unemployment and job ﬁnding rates measures.
Further, this version of the model still needs to accommodate short-term outﬂows
as before and does so mostly through search unemployment episodes. As a result,
the proportion of rest unemployment decreases at a slower rate with A. Even at
the highest aggregate productivity levels rest unemployment is very prevalent, rep-
resenting about 40% of all episodes during a non-employment spell, with a large
role for prime-aged workers. Overall we ﬁnd that a version of the excess mobil-
ity model that considers NUN spells exhibits a higher non-employment rate but a
lower cyclicality than in our benchmark model. This is consistent with the data,
where we observe a lower cyclicality among the non-employment than among the
unemployment.
B.3 The Importance of Occupational Mobility
To demonstrate the importance of including the zrcutoff to simultaneously replicate
the cyclical behaviour of the unemployment duration distribution and the aggregate
unemployment rate, we re-estimate the model by shutting down occupational mo-
bility. This is done by exogenously setting cto a prohibiting level. We present two
calibrations. Model I targets the same moments as in the full model with the excep-
tion of those pertaining to occupational mobility.33Model 2 is chosen to achieve a
33To make the estimation of Model I as comparable as possible with the previous ones, we continue
targeting the returns to occupational mobility to inform the human capital levels, x2and x3. Under
no occupational mobility, human capital could also be interpreted as general and not occupation
speciﬁc, depending on the aim of the exercise. In this sense it would be more appropriate to target the
returns to general experience. However, a comparison between the OLS returns to general experience
and the OLS returns to occupational human capital estimated by Kambourov and Manovskii (2009)

the full and excess mobility models. The estimated parameters are largely sensible.
Two key features stand out: (i) there is now a higher role for search frictions as the
model estimates a higher value k=195.58; and (ii) the zprocess is now less persis-
tentrz=0.9923 and exhibits a much larger variance sz=0.0300 in the stationary
distribution, generating a perhaps too large Mm ratio of 2.28.34Table 13 under “No
Occupational Mobility - Model I”, however, shows that this model cannot generate
enough cyclical volatility on all the relevant labor market variables.
Table 14 further shows that Model I is not able to reproduce the observed average
quarterly unemployment duration distribution at short or long durations (Panel A),
nor does it capture the cyclical behavior of this distribution (Panel B). While Model
I and the occupational mobility models replicate the same unemployment survival
functions, they generate different incomplete duration distributions. This occurs
because the survival functions are computed pooling the entire sample, while the
distribution of incomplete spells between 1 and 18 months is calculated for each
quarter and then averaged across quarters. Model I generates about 50% more long-
from the PSID (see their Table 3 comparing columns 1 and 3 or 6 and 8), suggests that this bias should
be moderate. Using their estimates, the 5 year return to general experience is about 0.19, while the
10 years returns is about 0.38.
34In this context the z-productivity process can be interpreted as an idiosyncratic productivity
shock affecting a worker’s overall productivity, rather than a worker’s idiosyncratic productivity
within an occupation.

term unemployment (9-12 months) relative to the data and the discrepancy is even
stronger, about 80%, at longer durations. That is, this model matches the unemploy-
ment survival functions by creating too dispersed unemployment durations within
a typical quarter, in particular too many long spells, but its distribution then re-
sponds too little to the cycle.
Model II If one is willing to compromise on replicating the aggregate and age-
group survival functions, however, the model without occupational mobility is able
to generate larger cyclical volatilities. To show this we re-estimated the model by
de-emphasising these survival functions. Once again we refer to Carrillo-Tudela
and Visschers (2020) for the ﬁt of this model and the estimated parameter values.
There we show that the unemployment survival functions of young and prime-aged
workers are no longer well matched. This model misses the distribution at longer
durations for young workers and at shorter durations for prime-aged workers, such
that age differences in job ﬁnding hazards have nearly disappeared. However, there
is now a lower degree of search frictions, k=102.019 and the zprocess is more
persistent, rz=0.993, and its overall dispersion is much lower than in Model I,
sz=0.0132. It is these last properties that allow Model II to create more cyclical
volatility as shown in the right panel of Table 12.
Panel A of Table 14 - No Occ. Model II shows that this model still creates
too much long-term unemployment (13-18 months) in the average quarter, where
the proportion of long-term unemployed (among those with spells between 1-18
68
----------------------------------------

[Page 70 of 269]
months) is missed by a large margin for all, young and prime-aged workers. Fur-
ther, Panel B of Table 14 shows that this feature is also reﬂected in a muted cyclical
response of the unemployment duration distribution. Here we also ﬁnd that Model
II misses the semi-elasticity with respect to the unemployment rate by an average of
about 40% across the duration distribution.35
Discussion These calibrations show that without the zrcutoff versions of our
model with no occupational mobility cannot resolve the tension between individual
unemployment outcomes and aggregate unemployment volatility. This arises as
without the possibility of occupational mobility the new area of inaction is deﬁned
by the set of z2[z,zs], where zis the lowest value of z, and its cyclical response
now solely depends on ¶zs/¶A.
In the case of Model I, a less persistent and much more volatile zprocess creates
enough heterogeneity in unemployment durations that allows it to match the em-
pirical unemployment survival functions at the aggregate and across age groups.
However, it also increases the heterogeneity in z-productivities relative to the cycli-
cal range of A. This dampens the model’s cyclical performance as it implies less
responsive zscutoffs relative to the workers’ zdistribution, weakening the cyclical
responses of job separations and the rate at which workers leave the area of inac-
tion. Moreover, with a larger vacancy posting cost, Figure 17.a shows that search
unemployment is now more prominent than rest unemployment at any point of the
cycle. Larger search frictions imply larger surpluses and therefore further reducing
the cyclical responsiveness of the model.
The increased cyclical performance of Model II arises as its estimated zpro-
cess becomes more persistent and less volatile, creating more responsive zscut-
offs leading to stronger cyclical responses in job separations, as well as much more
episodes of rest unemployment over all A. Figure 17.b shows that rest unemploy-
ment episodes are now more prominent than search unemployment episodes even
during economic recoveries. It is only for the highest values of Athat search un-
35In these versions of the model the behavior of spells with durations beyond 18 months might also
impact the overall unemployment rate more than empirically warranted, especially as persistence
can create a “ﬁrst-in last-out pattern” when entering a recession in the form of very long unemploy-
ment spells for those who lost their job early on in the recession. We focus on the distribution of spells
up to 18 months because censoring issues in the SIPP restrict how accurately we can investigate the
behavior of very long spells over the cycle.

employment is more prominent, but only by a relatively small margin. With more
responsive zscutoffs, an aggregate shock can now move somewhat larger masses
of workers from rest into search unemployment episodes creating more ampliﬁca-
tion. This result is in line with Chassamboulli (2013), who extends the DMP model
by adding permanent productivity differences among workers and shows that this
feature increases it cyclical performance relative to the data. Table 14 demonstrates,
however, that this comes at the cost of not being able to match the distribution of
unemployment durations nor the dynamic behavior of this distribution over the cy-
cle.36Thus, in Model II the average unemployment rate responds more to the cycle
as aggregate productivity takes on a more prominent role in shaping the amount
of rest unemployment, but the individual unemployment outcomes that underlie
these dynamics become counterfactual.
The possibility of occupational mobility would have given workers in rest un-
employment episodes another margin through which they can escape the area of
inaction and get re-employed faster. As a result, the individual-level unemploy-
ment duration dependence (given an aggregate state) is not only affected by zsbut
also by the distance to zr. Further, since the zrcutoff is at different distances from the
zsacross the cycle, it creates a more cyclically sensitive area of inaction. That is, oc-
36An extrapolation from the above discussion appears to suggest a model with permanent hetero-
geneity, where all moves in and out of rest unemployment would be because of aggregate productiv-
ity changes, cannot resolve the tension between cyclical performance and ﬁtting the unemployment
duration distribution moments. In principle our estimation allows and has evaluated in its procedure
parameter tuples with a near-permanent z-productivity process (i.e. a persistence approximating 1).
However, such parameter tuples yield larger deviations from the individual-level unemployment
outcomes we targeted compared to Model II.

cupational mobility creates a more responsive area of inaction with respect to both
worker heterogeneity and the business cycle that resolves the tensions discussed

Supplementary Appendix A: Occupational Coding Error
and its Correction
This appendix complements Section 2 of the paper and expands Online Ap-
pendix A. Here we quantify the extent to which coding errors affect the probabil-
ity of an occupational change after a non-employment spell. This is done in two
ways. (1) We exploit the change from independent to dependent interviewing that
occurred across the 1985 and 1986 SIPP panels, which overlap between February
1986 to April 1987. The change of interviewing technique allows us to estimate a
garbling matrix Gwhose elements denote the probability that a worker’s true oc-
cupation igets miscoded as another occupation j. (2) We then take advantage of
the retrospective coding exercise done to occupational codes in the PSID. Retrospec-
tive coding improved the assignment of the occupational codes obtained during the
1970s, but did not affect the codes obtained during later years (see also Kambourov
and Manovskii, 2008). We use probabilistic models to estimate the average effect
retrospective coding had on the probability of an occupational change.
Across these data sets we obtain a very similar conclusion. Our correction method
implies that on average 82% of the observed wave-to-wave occupational transitions
after re-employment in the SIPP are genuine, were each wave covers a 4 months
interval. In stark contrast, when pooling together workers who changed and did
not change employers, we ﬁnd that 40% of the observed changes among all work-
ers are genuine. Similarly, retrospective coding in the PSID implies that 84% of
the observed year-to-year occupational transitions after re-employment are genuine.
When pooling together workers who changed and did not change employers, ret-
rospective coding implies that only 44% are genuine. A key insight is that the same
propensities to miscode occupations affect very differently the measured occupa-
tional change of employer movers and employer stayers. This is important as it
implies one cannot use the error correction estimates obtained from pooled sam-
ples to adjust the occupational mobility statistics of those who changed employers
through spells of unemployment.
We use the estimated G-correction matrix to eliminate the impact of coding er-
rors on the occupational mobility statistics of the unemployed obtained from the
SIPP . We show that occupational miscoding increases observed excess mobility and
73

reduces the importance of net mobility (see also Kambourov and Manovskii, 2013).
It also makes occupational mobility appear less responsive to unemployment dura-
tion and the business cycle. In Supplementary Appendix B we use the SIPP to eval-
uate robustness of the occupational mobility patterns derived from our G-correction
method. To do so, we follow two alternative approaches of measuring occupational
mobility: (i) simultaneously mobility of major occupational and major industrial
groups at re-employment and (ii) self-reported duration of occupational tenure ob-
tained from the topical modules. The ﬁrst measure is considered less sensitive to
miscoding as it typically requires errors to be made simultaneously along two di-
mensions. The second captures the worker’s own perception of occupational mo-
bility and is not based on occupational coding. We ﬁnd that the occupational mo-
bility patterns obtained through our classiﬁcation error model applied to the SIPP ,
the retrospective coding in the PSID and these alternative measures provide a very
consistent picture.
A.1 A classiﬁcation error model
In Section 2.1 of the main text we deﬁned the matrix G, where its elements are
the probabilities that an occupation iis miscoded as an occupation j, for all i,j=
1, 2, ..., O. There is an important literature that investigates classiﬁcation error mod-
els. Magnac and Visser (1999) identify two main branches. The ﬁrst one uses as-
sumptions on the measurement error process and auxiliary data on the error rates,
where it is assumed that the error rates can be directly observe from the auxiliary
data (see Abowd and Zellner, 1985, Poterba and Summers, 1986, and Magnac and
Visser, 1999, among others). The second one does not rely on auxiliary data on error
rates, but estimates parametric models in the presence of misclassiﬁed data, where
these models are either reduced form statistical models (see Hausman et al. 1998,
among others) or structural economic models (see Kean and Wolpin, 2001, Sullivan,
2009, Roys and Taber, 2017, among others).
Our classiﬁcation error model builds on Abowd and Zellner (1985) and Poterba
and Summer (1986) in that it uses a garbling matrix that captures the errors made in
classifying workers. These authors investigate the misclassiﬁcation of individuals’
employment status in the CPS and use reported employment status at the original
74
----------------------------------------

[Page 76 of 269]
interview date, at the re-interviewing date (which occurred one week after the orig-
inal interview) and the reconciliation information provided by the CPS to directly
observe the garbling matrix. Their key assumption is that the reconcile informa-
tion provides the true individuals’ labor market status. In contrast, we do not have
auxiliary information that allows us to directly recover the garbling matrix. Our
challenge is to estimate the garbling matrix.
Our classiﬁcation error model also relates to Sullivan (2009) in that both ap-
proaches provide estimates of an occupation garbling matrix. In contrast, our ap-
proach does not rely on the observed optimal choices of economic agents for iden-
tiﬁcation. Rather, miscoding can be estimated using the occupational transitions
alone, without requiring further information on wages which themselves can be
subject to measurement error. Therefore, it is much simpler to implement relative to
Sullivan’s (2009) approach which relies on time costly simulation maximum likeli-
hood methods that end up restricting the size of the estimated garbling matrix. This
is important as it reduces the overall computational burden when estimating our
economic model.
To identify and estimate Gwe make three assumptions:
(A1)Independent classiﬁcation errors : conditional on the true occupation, the real-
ization of an occupational code does not depend on workers’ labor market histories,
demographic characteristics or the time it occurred in our sample. This assumption
is also present in Poterba and Summers (1986) and Abowd and Zellner (1985) and
is consistent with independent interviewing. In the standard practise of indepen-
dent interviewing, professional coders base their coding on the verbatim descrip-
tion of the reported work activities without taking into account the respondents’
demographic characteristics or earlier work history.37Errors introduced by the re-
spondents, however, could be correlated with their characteristics. Assumption A1
implies that errors in the individuals’ verbatim responses are fully captured by the
nature of the job these individuals are performing and hence only depend on their
true occupation. Another implication of assumption A1is that Gis time-invariant.
This is important as we will apply our correction method across all years in our
37For example, during the 1980s and 1990s independent occupational coding in the PSID was done
without reference to respondents’ characteristics or their work history. However, this information
was used in the retrospective coding exercise done to the 1970s occupational codes.

sample and one could be concern whether the coding errors estimated in the 1980’s
are similar to those founds 20 years later. In Section 4 (below) we investigate further
these implications.
(A2)“Detailed balance” in miscoding :diag(c)Gis symmetric, where cis aOx1 vec-
tor that describes the distribution of workers across occupations and diag(c)is the
diagonal matrix of c. This assumption is known as “detailed balance”. It implies
that the number of workers whose true occupation igets mistakenly coded as jis
the same as the number of workers whose true occupation jgets mistakenly coded
asi, such that the overall size of occupations do not change with coding error. This
assumption allow us to invert Gand hence aids our identiﬁcation arguments. Al-
though undeniably strong, this assumption is a weaker version of the one proposed
by Keane and Wolpin (2001) and subsequently used Roys and Taber (2017) to correct
of occupation miscoding. We return to discuss A2in Section 4.
(A3)Strict diagonal dominance :Gis strictly diagonally dominant in that gii>0.5
for all i=1, 2, ..., O. This assumption is also present in Hausman et al., (1998) and
implies that it is more likely to correctly code a given occupation ithan to miscoded
it. The converse would imply occupational mobility rates that are of a magnitude
inconsistent with our data. Indeed, we derive an upper bound on code error directly
from the data and ﬁnd that A3is veriﬁed in our data.
To estimate Gwe exploit the change of survey design between the 1985 and 1986
SIPP panels. Until the 1985 panel the SIPP used independent interviewing for all
workers: in each wave all workers were asked to describe their job anew, without
reference to answers given at an earlier date. Subsequently, a coder would con-
sider that wave’s verbatim descriptions and allocate occupational codes. This prac-
tise is known to generate occupational coding errors. In the 1986 panel, instead,
the practise changed to one of dependent interviewing (see Lynn and Sala, 2007,
Jäckle, 2008, and Jäckle and Eckman, 2020). Respondents were only asked “inde-
pendently” to describe their occupation if they reported a change in employer or if
they reported a change in their main activities without an employer change within
the last 8 months. If respondents declared no change in employer andin their main
activities, the occupational code assigned to the respondent in the previous wave is
carried forward.
It is important to note that during February 1986 to April 1987, the 1985 and 1986

panels overlap, representing the same population under different survey designs.
The identiﬁcation theory we develop in the next section refers to this population.
We then show how to consistently estimate Gusing the population samples.
A.1.1 Identiﬁcation of G
Consider the population represented by 1985/86 panels during the overlapping
period and divide it into two groups of individuals across consecutive interviews
by whether or not they changed employer or activity. Label those workers who
stayed with their employers in both interviews and did not change activity as “em-
ployer/activity stayers”. By design this group only contains true occupational stay-
ers. Similarly, label those workers who changed employers or changed activity
within their employers as “employer/activity changers”. By design this group con-
tains all true occupational movers and the set of true occupational stayers who
changed employers.
Suppose that we were to subject the employer/activity stayers in this population
to dependent interviewing as applied in the 1986 panel. Let csdenote the Ox1 vector
that describes their true distribution across occupations and let Ms=diag(cs). In
what follows we will use the convention that the (i,j)’th element of an Mmatrix
indicates the ﬂow from occupation itoj. Let cD
sdenote the Ox1 vector that describes
their observed distribution across occupations under dependent interviewing and let
MD
s=diag(cD
s). Note that cD
s=G0Ms  !1, where  !1describes a vector of ones. Ms
is pre-multiplied by G0as true occupations would have been miscoded in the ﬁrst of
the two consecutive interviews. “Overall balance”, a weaker version of A2, implies
that cD
s=diag(cs)G  !1=csand hence MD
s=Ms.38
Next suppose that instead we were to subject the employer/activity stayers in
this population to independent interviewing as applied in the 1985 panel. Let MI
s
denote the matrix that contains these workers’ observed occupational transition ﬂows
under independent interviewing. In this case MI
s=G0MsG. Here Msis pre-multiplied
byG0and post-multiplied by Gto take into account that the observed occupations of
origin and destination would be subject to coding error.
38Overall balance only requires that classiﬁcation errors do not change the overall occupational
distribution rather than the bilateral ﬂows between occupations as also required by detailed balance
inA2.
77
----------------------------------------

[Page 79 of 269]
LetMmdenote the matrix that contains the true occupational transition ﬂows of
employer/activity changers in this population. The diagonal of Mmdescribes the
distribution of true occupational stayers across occupations among employer/activity
changers. The off-diagonal elements contain the ﬂows of all true occupational movers.
Under independent interviewing we observe MI
m=G0MmG. Once again Mmis pre-
multiplied by G0and post-multiplied by Gas the observed occupations of origin and
destination would be subject to coding error.
Letting MI=MI
m+MI
sdenote the matrix that contains the aggregate occupa-
tional transition ﬂows across two interview dates under independent interviewing,
it follows that MI
s=MI MI
m=G0MsG. By virtue of the symmetry of Msand “de-
tailed balance” ( A2),MsG=G0Ms0=G0Ms. Substituting back yields MI
s=MsGG.
Next note that MI
s=MsTI
s, where TI
sis the occupational transition probability ma-
trix of the employer/activity stayers in this population observed under independent
interviewing. Substitution yields MsTI
s=MsGG. Multiply both sides by M 1
s,
which exists as long as all the diagonal elements of Msare non-zero, yields the key
relationship we exploit to estimate G,
TI
s=GG. (8)
To use this equation we ﬁrst need to show that it implies a unique solution for
G. Towards this result, we now establish that Gand TI
sare diagonalizable. For the
latter it is useful to interpret the coding error process described above as a Markov
chain such that Gis the one-step probability matrix associated with this process.
Lemma A.1: Assumptions A2 and A3 imply that GandTI
sare diagonalizable.
Proof. First note that without loss of generality we can consider the one-step prob-
ability matrix Gto be irreducible. To show this suppose that Gwas not irreducible,
we can (without loss of generality) apply a permutation matrix to re-order occu-
pations in Gand create a block-diagonal G0, where each block is irreducible and
can be considered in isolation. Given A3, it follows directly that Gis aperiodic.
Further, assumption A2implies that csis a stationary distribution of G. The fun-
damental theorem of Markov chains then implies that csis the unique stationary
distribution of G. Assumption A2also implies that the Markov chain characterised

byGis reversible with respect to cs. This means that Gis similar (in matrix sense)
to a symmetric matrix Gsuch that G=diag(pcs)Gdiag(pcs) 1. By symme-
try,Gis orthogonally diagonalizable by QDQ 1, where the diagonal matrix Dcon-
tains the associated (real) eigenvalues and Qis the orthogonal matrix of associated
(normalized) eigenvectors. It then follows that Gis diagonalizable as well. Fur-
ther, TI
s=diag(pcs) 1G G diag (pcs) =diag(pcs) 1QD2Q 1diag(pcs), and
hence TI
sis also orthogonally diagonalizable, with a root of PL0.5P 1, where Lis
the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of TI
s, and Pthe associated orthogonal matrix
with eigenvectors of TI
s.
In general one cannot guarantee the uniqueness, or even existence, of a transition
matrix that is the (nth)root of another transition matrix (see Higham and Lin, 2011).
Here, however, existence is obtained by construction: Tsis constructed from G, and
in reverse, we can ﬁnd its roots. The next result shows that Tshas a unique root
satisfying assumptions A2and A3.
Proposition A.1: Gis the unique solution to TI
s=G Gthat satisﬁes assumptions A2 and
A3. It is given by PL0.5P 1, where Lis the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of TI
s,0<
li1, and Pis the orthogonal matrix with the associated (normalized) eigenvectors.
Proof. Following from the proof of Lemma A.1, a root of TI
sis given by PL0.5P 1,
where Lis the diagonal matrix with eigenvalues of TI
sand Pis the orthogonal ma-
trix with the associated (normalized) eigenvectors. Since A3implies Gis strictly di-
agonally dominant, it follows that the determinant of all its leading principal minors
are positive. Moreover, under the similarity transform by pre-/post-multiplication
with the diagonal matrices diag(pcs),diag(pcs) 1, the determinant of all princi-
pals minors of the symmetric matrix G=diag(pcs)Gdiag(pcs) 1are positive
as well. Hence Gis a symmetric positive deﬁnite matrix (with all eigenvalues be-
tween 0 and 1, as has G). It follows that G G =Sis also positive deﬁnite, and
TI
s=diag(pcs) 1S diag (pcs)is positive deﬁnite in the sense that v0TI
sv>0 for
allv6=0, while also all eigenvalues of TI
swill be between 0 and 1.
To show the uniqueness of the root of TI
ssuppose (towards a contradiction)
that there exists two different roots GandUsuch that each are similar (in matrix
sense), with the same transform involving diag(pcs), to different symmetric pos-
itive deﬁnite matrices Gand Y, where G G =Sand Y Y=S. Both Gand Y
79
----------------------------------------

[Page 81 of 269]
are diagonalizable, and have the square roots of the eigenvalues of Son the diago-
nal. Given that the squares of the eigenvalues need to coincide with the eigenval-
ues of Sand assumptions A2and A3imply that all eigenvalues must be between
0 and 1, without loss of generality we can consider both diagonalizations to have
the same diagonal matrix D, where Dis the diagonal matrix of eigenvalues of TI
s
and these eigenvalues are ordered using a permutation-similarity transform with
the appropriate permutation matrices. Let G=HDH 1and Y=KDK 1. Then,
it follows that K 1HD2H 1K=D2and since K 1HandD2commute, implies that
K 1His a block-diagonal matrix with the size of the blocks corresponding to the
multiplicity of squared eigenvalues. Again, since all eigenvalues of Dare positive,
this equals the multiplicity of the eigenvalues diitself. But then it must be true that
K 1HDH 1K=D. Then, G=HDH 1=KK 1HDH 1KK 1=KDK 1=Y
which leads to a contradiction.
The above results imply that under assumptions A2and A3,Gis uniquely iden-
tiﬁed from the transition matrix of true occupational stayers under independent

A.1.2 Estimation of G
The next lemma provides an intermediate step towards estimating G. For this pur-
pose let PDT(.)denote the space of transition matrices that are similar, in the matrix
sense, to positive deﬁnite matrices.
Lemma A.2: The function f :PDT(ROO)!PDT(ROO)given by f (T) = T0.5
exists and is continuous with f (TI
s) =Gin the spectral matrix norm.
Proof. Existence follows from Lemma A.1 and Proposition A.1. To establish con-
tinuity of the mapping, we follow Horn and Johnson (1990). Let T1and T2be
any two transition matrices in PDT and let U1and U2be two symmetric posi-

nal matrix with eigenvalues of ˆTI
s, 0<ˆli0.51 and ˆPthe orthogonal matrix with
the associated (normalized) eigenvectors. We then have the following result.

Proof. From Lemma A.1 and Proposition A.1 it follows that if we know TI
s, then
we can ﬁnd the unique Gthat underlies it, constructing it from the eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of TI
s. To estimate TI
sone can use the sample proportion ˆMij/åO
k=1ˆMik
and note that this converges in probability to (TI
s)ij(see Anderson and Goodman,
1957; Billingsley 1961, thm 1.1-3.) for all occupations, given assumptions A2and
A3. Hence, plim n!¥ˆTI
s=TI
s. Then, we derive ˆGfromˆTI
saccording to ˆPˆL0.5ˆP 1,
per Proposition A.1. By continuity of the mapping in Lemma A.2, it follows that
plim n!¥ˆG=G, and our estimator is consistent.
Note that to identify and estimate Gin the SIPP it is not sufﬁcient to directly
compare the aggregate occupational transition ﬂows under independent interview-
ing with the aggregate occupational transition ﬂows under dependent interviewing.

1)exogenous variables on the LHS and 0.5 n(n+1)unknowns (endogenous vari-
ables) on the RHS, leaving G(and Ms) unidentiﬁed.
In addition to MD MI=Ms G0MsGone can use MD=G0MmG+Ms, which
contains the remainder information. When Mmhas mass on its diagonal, however,
this additional system of equations has n2exogenous variables on the LHS and n2
unknowns (arising from Mm) on the RHS. This implies that with the nunknowns
remaining from MD MI=Ms G0MsG, one is still unable to identify Gand Ms.
Corollary A.1: IfMmhas mass on its diagonal, Gcannot be identiﬁed from MIandMD
alone.
The intuition behind this result is that by comparing aggregate occupational
transition ﬂows under dependent and independent interviewing, it is unclear how
many workers are ‘responsible’ for the change in occupational mobility between MD
and MI. Only when the diagonal of Mmcontains exclusively zeros, identiﬁcation
could be resolved and one can recover Ms,Gand Mmas the number of equations
equals the number of unknowns.39An implication of the above corollary is that
interrupted time-series analysis that is based on the difference in occupational mo-
bility at the time of a switch from independent to dependent interviewing, does not
identify the precise extent of the average coding error, but provides a downwards
biased estimate.
To identify G, however, Proposition A.2 implies that one can use the observed
occupational transition ﬂows of a sample of true occupational stayers that are sub-
ject to two rounds of independent interviewing. Some of these workers will appear
as occupational stayers and some of them as occupational movers. Ideally, such a
sample of workers should be isolated directly from the 1985 panel. Unfortunately,
the questions on whether the individual changed activity or employer were only
introduced in the 1986 panel, as a part of the switch to dependent interviewing.
As a result, the 1985 panel by itself does not provide sufﬁcient information to sep-
arate employer/activity stayers from employer/activity movers. Instead we use
39However, in the SIPP this case is empirically unreasonable as it requires that all em-
ployer/activity changers be true occupational movers.

m. We can infer MI
sindirectly by subtracting the observed
occupational transition ﬂow matrix ˆMI
min the 1986 panel from the observed occu-
pational transition ﬂow matrix ˆMIin the 1985 panel. This is possible as the 1986
panel refers to the same underlying population as the 1985 panel and separates the
employer/activity changers, who are independently interviewed.

This result is important to implement our approach. It follows as the population
proportions underlying each cell of ˆMs, the sample estimate of Ms, are consistently
estimated. In turn, the latter follows from the standard central limit theorem for
estimating proportions, which applies to ˆMI,ˆMI
mand its difference. Proposition
A.2 then implies that ˆGis consistently estimated.
A.1.3 Implementation
To implement our correction method we take the overlapping period of the 1985/86
panels. To increase the sample size we also use observations from the 1987 panel
for the period between February 1987 and April 1987.40This panel has an identical
setup to that of the 1986 panel (dependent interviewing and other relevant aspects)
and is likewise representative of the population during the period of study.
Interviews throughout the SIPP are conducted every four months and collect
information pertaining to the last four months, where these four months are con-
sidered to be a wave. We compare the reported occupational code of a worker in
a given interview with the reported occupational code of that worker in the subse-
quent interview. An observation is therefore a pair of occupational codes, a reported
‘source’ and (potentially identical) ‘destination’ occupation. To keep comparability
across interviews as clean as possible, and to focus on measuring occupations in the
primary job, we only consider those workers who throughout the two waves stayed
in full-time employment and who reported having only one employer at any point
in time. These restrictions imply that in the estimation of Gwe do not include non-
temporary laid off workers who experienced a short unemployment episodes and
40To avoid seasonality effects we re-weight all observations such that each observation in a given
month has the same weight as another observation in any other month.

returned to their same jobs and employers. We also restrict attention to those work-
ers who do not have imputed occupations, were not enrolled in school and were
between 19-66 years old. These restrictions yield 28,302 wave/individual observa-
tions for the 1985 panel, 27,801 wave/individual observations for the 1986 panel
and 5,922 wave/individual observations for the 1987 panel.

Workers aged 19-66, not enrolled in school, in two adjacent waves, measured in the ﬁrst month of the current wave, with employment
in one ﬁrm only in the previous wave, and employment in one (but possibly different) employer only in the wave that follows, without
any self-employment, with un-imputed occupations reported in both waves. Person weights are used to scale observations per month
within panel group (1985 versus 1986+1987).
Tables 15 and 16 show the demographic and occupational characteristics (based
on the major occupations of the 1990 SOC), respectively, of the samples across the
three panels. In the last column of each table we test characteristic-by-characteristic
whether the proportion of workers with a given characteristic in the 1985 sample is
statistically indistinguishable from the proportion of workers with the same char-
acteristic in the pooled 1986/87 sample. Across all the characteristics analysed, we
84
----------------------------------------

[Page 86 of 269]
cannot reject at a 5% level that the proportions in the 1985 sample and the corre-
sponding proportions in the 1986-87 sample are the same. With the exception of the
proportion of Asian Americans and the proportion of workers whose source occu-
pation is management, similarity cannot be rejected even at a 10% level. Although
not shown here, we also cannot rejected at a 10% level that the proportion of work-
ers across source and destination industries are the same when comparing the 1985
and 1986/87 samples. This analysis thus conﬁrm that the observations used for our
exercise are taken from the same underlying population.41
We estimate the occupational ﬂows of employer/activity stayers by ˆMI,85 ˆMI,86/87
m =
ˆMI
s, where x=85 (x=86/87) in ˆMI,x
irefers to the 1985 sample (1986/87 sample). In
the 1986/87 sample, where we can observe employer/activity changers directly, we
ﬁnd that in 2.31% of (weighted) observations workers changed employers and in
4.65% workers report an activity change within their employers. This implies that
more than 93% of the 1985 sample should be made up of employer/activity stayers.
A potential concern from using this survey design change could be the reliabil-
ity in the 1986 implementation of dependent interviewing and its comparison with
the data collected in the overlapping period of the 1985 panel. For example, any
trail/learning period in the implementation of dependent interviewing in the 1986
panel could affect our results. To evaluate whether any trial/learning period in the
implementation of dependent interviewing affected the occupational mobility rates
we compare the occupational mobility rates obtained from the 1986 panel to those
obtained from subsequent ones. Assuming improvements made after 1986 affected
the measurement of occupational mobility, we should observe a meaningful change
in these rates when using subsequent panels. Figure 18 (see below for a detail expla-
nation of the graph) suggests that any trail/learning period in the implementation
of dependent interviewing did not have a major effect on average occupational mo-
bility.42
41To further rule out any meaningful impact from the observed differences in occupational dis-
tributions, we re-calculated all statistics after re-balancing the weights on the source/destination
occupations to create identical occupational distributions. This exercise yields minimal effects on
our statistics. For example, the observed occupational mobility changes by 0.01 percentage point at
most. The reason for this small change is because there is the large proportion of the implied true
stayers in the sample, which means that ˆTI
sis not very sensitive to proportional changes in ˆMI
m.
42This is consistent with Hill (1994), who instead points to a potential higher level of attrition in the
“older” 1985 panel relative to the “newer” 1986 panel as a concern. He argues that using the “1986
ﬁnal panel weights, taken from the 1985 and 1986 Full Panel Longitudinal Research Files”, while not

A.2 Results and Discussion
Table 3 shows the occupational transition matrix ˆTI
sfor true occupational stayers
derived from ˆMI
susing the 1985 sample based on the major occupations of the 1990
SOC. The (i,j)’th element of ˆTI
sindicates the transition probability from occupation
itoj. This matrix implies that 18.46% of true occupational stayers get classiﬁed as
perfect, seem to be the best available solution to tackle this problem. We follow the same practice in
our analysis.

we calculate the same matrix based on the 2000 SOC, which we use for our results

A.2.1 The estimate of G
Following Proposition A.1we can then recover the garbling matrix Gby using ˆTI
s
and equation (8). Table 4 shows the estimated ˆGbased on the major occupations of
the 1990 SOC, while Table 19 shows the estimated ˆGbased on the major occupations
of the 2000 SOC. These estimates imply that on average the incorrect occupational
code is assigned in around 10% of the cases. Since a spurious transition is likely to
be created when either the source or destination occupation is miscoded, the proba-
bility of observing a spurious transition for a true occupational stayer is nearly twice
as large. Our methodology then suggests that coding error is indeed substantial un-
43This value lies within the expected bounds. To construct an upper bound consider the 1985
sample and assume that all observed occupational transitions are spurious. In this case we can
expect that at most 19.71% of the observations would be miscoded. To construct a lower bound
consider the 1986/87 sample and calculate the number of observations in which an occupational
move is reported among the employer/activity changers. These observations account for 2.60% of
all observations in the 1986/87 sample. Assuming that the effect of miscoding is to generate a net
increase in the number of occupational changes, we can expect that at least 19.71%-2.60% =17.11% of
the observations would be miscoded.

der independent interviewing. Its magnitude is of similar order as found in other
studies analysing the extent of errors in occupational coding (see Campanelli et al.,

Two additional messages come out of Tables 4 and 19. (i) Different occupations
have very different propensities to be assigned a wrong code. For example, when
using the 1990 SOC we ﬁnd that individuals whose true occupation is “laborers”
have a 74% probability of being coded correctly, while individuals whose true occu-
pation is “professional speciality” have a 94% probability of being coded correctly.
(ii) Given a true occupation, some coding mistakes are much more likely than oth-
ers. For example, workers whose true occupation is “laborers” have a much larger
probability to be miscoded as “machine operators” (5.7%), “construction” (4.5%) or
“admin. support” (4.8%) than as “managers” (0.3%) or “professionals” (0.1%). Our
methodology enable us to take these differences into account by correcting observed
occupational ﬂows by source-destination occupation pair. This provides cleaner net
mobility estimates, where the identity of the origin and destination occupation mat-
ters.

A.2.2 The effect of ˆGon the gross occupational mobility rate
Figure 18 depicts the effect of ˆGwhen computing wave-to-wave occupational mobility
rates using the major occupational groups of the 2000 SOC. For this exercise we aug-
ment the 1985/86/87 samples with workers from the 1984 and 1988 panels, which
satisfy the same sample restrictions as before. Figure 18 depicts the average wave-
to-wave occupational mobility rate obtained during each year. For the year 1986
we only use the observations that cover the February to December period obtained
from the 1986 sample. We label these observations “1986s” as they are the ones we
use in our original sample to estimate ˆG. In the case of the year 1987, we present the
average occupational mobility rate obtained for the January to April period (labelled
“1987s”) separately from the average occupational mobility rate obtained from the
remaining months (labelled “1987r”). The two vertical lines mark the time period
in which dependent and independent interviewing overlap.

lie between 19.6%-20% and average 19.7% between the vertical lines. Under inde-
pendent interviewing, Mmis garbled both at the source and destination occupations

and hence is observed as G0MmG. Pre- and post-multiplying the latter by the respec-
tive inverses (G0) 1,G 1recovers (G0) 1G0MmGG 1=Mm. Applying this procedure
to the 1984/85 samples yields the long-dashed line with hollow triangular markers.
The result is a drop in the occupational mobility rate to about 1.6%.
Next consider the 1986/88 samples. Here independent interviewing is only
applied to employer/activity changers. Therefore, the observed overall occupa-
tional mobility rate for these samples is based on MD,86/87
s +MI,86/87
m . The matrix
MD,86/87
s does not contribute to any occupational transitions while matrix MI,86/87
m
does. This difference implies a much lower observed aggregate mobility rate. The
latter is depicted by the short-dashed line with ﬁlled circular markers in Figure 18
and averages 2.6%. Correcting the occupational ﬂows of the 1986-88 samples us-
ing ˆMD,86/87
s + (ˆG0) 1ˆMI,86/87
mˆG 1yields the series depicted by the long-dashed line
with solid triangular markers. The result is a drop in the occupational mobility rate
to about 1.7%, which is very close to the G-corrected occupational mobility rate from
the 1984/85 samples. Indeed, in Figure 18 the blue (independent-interviewing) and
red (dependent-interviewing) long-dashed lines of the G-corrected measures nearly
coincide between the two vertical lines.44
The fact that we obtain very similar corrected mobility rates after using the same
underlying G-correction matrix in two different survey designs, suggests that our
methodology captures the extent of coding error quite well. Our methodology also
seems to work well in other dimensions. We ﬁnd that the occupational mobility
rates in the years before 1986 are adjusted downwards to numbers that are very
similar to the numbers obtain during the 1986s-1987s window. For example, the
G-corrected occupational mobility in 1985 is 1.63%, while during the 1986s-1987s
window we obtain 1.62%. For the years after the 1986s-1987s window, we ﬁnd
that the G-corrected occupational mobility rate is within 0.02% of the one obtained
during this window. Further, Figure 18 shows that any changes in the level of the
G-corrected occupational mobility rate series appear to track changes in the uncor-
rected series. This also suggests that our correction method does not seem to intro-
duce additional randomness into the occupational mobility process.
We apply our G-correction method to those who changed employers with an in-

tervening spell of unemployment or non-employment. We then compute the host
of statistics shown in the main text and Supplementary Appendix B. We show that
occupational miscoding increases observed gross mobility. In the raw data we com-
pute an occupational mobility rate at re-employment of 53.1% based on the 2000
SOC. After applying our G-correction, we obtain an occupational mobility rate at re-
employment of 44.4%. We also ﬁnd that coding errors makes occupational mobility
appear less responsive to unemployment duration. Since in short unemployment
spells true occupational staying is more common, miscoding creates relatively more
spurious mobility and therefore our method corrects more the short spells, leading
to a steeper relationship between occupational mobility and unemployment dura-
tion (see Table 1 and Figure 1 in Supplementary Appendix B). Miscoding also re-
duces the degree of procyclicality of gross mobility. This arises as coding errors will
generate more spurious mobility in times were there are more true stayers (see Table
6 and Figure 11 in Supplementary Appendix B).
In contrast, we ﬁnd that miscoding reduces the contribution of net occupational
mobility (see also Kambourov and Manovskii, 2013). The average net mobility rate
(as deﬁned in the main text) increases from 3.6% (uncorrected) to 4.2% (corrected),
a nearly 15% increase. To understand why this arises, consider the true net mobility
transition ﬂow matrix, Mnet, and note that this matrix does not have mass on its
diagonal. Under independent interviewing coding errors imply that the true net
mobility matrix would be observed as MI
net=G0MnetG, which could have mass
on the diagonal and hence biasing downwards net mobility ﬂows. That is, coding
errors mistakenly convert some true mobility ﬂows into occupational stays, while
miscoding for stayers is completely symmetric with respect to origin and destination
occupations, and therefore should not give rise to spurious net mobility.
A.2.3 The differential impact of coding error on employer/activity
stayers and movers
Note that our G-corrected occupational mobility rate for those workers who changed
employers through a spell of unemployment is 16.4% lower than the raw one (44.4%
vs 53.1%, 2000 SOC). This adjustment is much smaller in relative terms than the one
suggested by Kambourov and Manovskii (2008). They argue that on average around
92
----------------------------------------

[Page 94 of 269]
50% of allyear-to-year observed occupational mobility in the raw PSID data is due
to coding error. Indeed when constructing the year-to-year occupational mobility
rate for our pooled sample of employer/activity stayers and movers in the SIPP , we
ﬁnd that only 39.3% of observed occupational changes are genuine (an uncorrected
rate of 26.7% vs a G-corrected rate of 10.5%).
These ﬁndings are not mutually inconsistent. The key to this difference is that
therelative importance of coding error varies greatly with the true propensity of an
occupational change among employer stayers and among employer changers. True
occupational changes are more likely to be accompanied by changes in employers
(for examples of this argument see Hill, 1994, Moscarini and Thomsson, 2007, and
Kambourov and Manovskii, 2009) and, vice versa, employer changes are more likely
to be accompanied by occupational changes. As such, the relative adjustment that
Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) ﬁnd does not automatically carry over to differ-
ent subsets of workers or ﬂows measured at a different frequency.
As an example, consider an individual who is observed moving from “man-
agers” to “laborers”. Suppose “managers” was this individual’s true source occu-
pation, but the observed destination occupation was the result of coding error. If this
individual is a true occupational stayer, the observed transition will wrongly tell us
that the individual stopped being a manager and will generate a false occupational
move. Instead, if this individual is a true occupational mover, the observed transi-
tion, although wrongly coded, will still capture the fact that the individual stopped
being a manager and hence will capture a true occupational move. Given that
true occupational changes are more likely to occur along side employer changes,
there will be more workers among employer changers (relative to employer stay-
ers) whose categorization as an observed occupational mover will not change after
using the G-correction. This implies that the measured occupational mobility rate
of employer changers would have a relative smaller adjustment than the measured
occupational mobility rate of employer stayers. Kambourov and Manovskii (2008)
pooled together employer changers and stayers. Since the latter group represent
the vast majority of workers in their sample (as well as in our sample), the relative
adjustment proposed by these authors is naturally much larger.
Consider the following iterative back-of-the-envelope approximation to under-
stand why there must be a larger proportion of true occupational movers among
93
----------------------------------------

[Page 95 of 269]
those who changed employers than among those who did not change employers.
Recall that the G-correction method implies that true occupational stayers will be
coded as movers in about 20% of the times. This happens irrespectively of whether
the worker changed employers or not. If we were to suppose that all of the un-
employed who regain employment were true occupational stayers, the difference
between their observed mobility rate (53%) and coding error (20%) would imme-
diately imply that among the unemployed there must be true occupational movers
and these true movers would represent at least 33% of the unemployed. This re-
sult then shrinks the population of occupational stayers (the “population at risk”)
among the unemployed to at most 67%, which (proceeding iteratively) implies the
maximum extent of spurious ﬂows produced under the same miscoding propensity
is reduced to 0.267%. In turn, the latter implies an updated lower bound on the
percentage of true occupational movers among the unemployed of 39.6%. Proceed-
ing iteratively, one arrives to a lower bound on the percentage of true occupational
movers among the unemployed of 41.25%, which is close to the gross mobility we
obtained after applying the G-correction. A similar procedure but applied to em-
ployer stayers shows a much lower ‘true’ mobility rate among this group.

Sample: unemployed between 1983-2013, in 1984-2008 SIPP panels, subject to conditions explained in data construction appendix (most importantly: unimputed

P(˜o6=ojU): probability that the wrong code is assigned to an unemployed worker; P(˜M): observed occupational mobility among the unemployed; P(M): inferred
underlying true mobility (proportion of unemployed). NR/R refers to routine vs. non-routine. Further details on the classiﬁcations are explained in the data construction
appendix.
Table 20 shows that the differential impact of coding error on employer changers
and stayers is present when considering several alternative occupational classiﬁca-
tions as well as mobility across industries. In all these cases we use wave-to-wave
mobility rates. The ﬁrst column, P(˜MjS), presents the probability that a true em-
ployer/activity stayer in the 1985 sample is assigned the wrong occupational code
94
----------------------------------------

[Page 96 of 269]
and hence is observed as an occupational mover ˜M. This probability is 17.8% when
using the 2000 SOC. This implies that under independent interviewing we will ob-
serve an occupational mobility rate of 17.8% among the employer/activity stayers.
This rate increases slightly when using the 1990 SOC, 19.7%, and remains high even
when we aggregate occupations into six categories, 14.8%.45Aggregating occupa-
tions into four tasked based categories (routine vs. non-routine and manual vs.
cognitive) only brings down the observed mobility rate of true occupational stayers
to 11%. As many other studies, we also ﬁnd the probability that a true stayer is
observed as a mover is lower when considering industries instead of occupations.
The second and third columns show the observed, P(˜MjU), and G-corrected,
P(MjU), occupational mobility rate of those workers who changed employers through
unemployment. These are obtained using the probability that an unemployed worker
in the 1984-2008 SIPP panels is assigned the wrong occupational code at re-employment,
P(˜o6=ojU). We observe that across all classiﬁcations the (relative) difference be-
tween the observed and the G-corrected occupational mobility rates of the unem-
ployed, P(˜MjU) P(MjU), is about half the size of P(˜MjS). The fourth column
shows this difference in relative terms. It is clear that across all classiﬁcations the
same coding error generates a much larger difference (in absolute and relative terms)
between the observed and G-corrected occupational mobility rates of employer stay-
ers than among employer changers.
A.3 Measuring coding error in the PSID
We now broaden the above analysis and use probabilistic models based on the PSID
(as in Kambourov and Manovskii, 2008) to assess the impact of coding errors on the
probability of an occupational change. The advantage of the G-correction method is
that it captures all sources of error in assigning occupation codes. It delivers an iden-
tiﬁcation procedure that is not subject to the issue highlighted in Corollary A.1 and
that recovers the extent to which coding errors arise at the level of each occupation.
Further, the SIPP provides a large sample size in which we can apply our correction
45The six groups are: (1) managers/professional speciality; (2) tech support/admin support/sales;
(3) services; (4) farm/forest/ﬁsheries; (5) precision production/craft/repair; and (6) operators, fab-
ricators and laborers. These correspond to the summary occupational group of the 1990 SOC.
95

[Page 97 of 269]
method. The advantage of the PSID is that retrospective coding affected directly
the way occupational transitions among employer changers were measured. We
exploit this feature and assess the impact of coding error on employer movers and
employer stayers separately and compare the results with the ones obtained from
the SIPP using our G-correction method. We ﬁnd a very consistent picture across the
two data sets.
To assess the impact of retrospective coding in reducing coding errors, we use the
PSID retrospective occupation-industry supplementary data ﬁles, which contain the
re-coding the PSID staff performed on the occupational mobility records obtained
during the 1968-1980 period. Since the 1981-1997 records were not re-coded and col-
lected under independent interviewing, the earlier period can be used to construct
“clean” occupational mobility rates and to analyse the effect of measurement error
at the coding stage. In constructing our sample we closely follow Kambourov and
Manovskii (2008, 2009). The details of this sample are described in the Supplemen-
tary Appendix B.7.
A.3.1 Gross occupational mobility rates
As in Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) we deﬁne the overall occupational mobility
rate as the fraction of employed workers whose occupational code differs between
years tand t+1 divided by the number of workers who were employed in year t. As
these authors we also consider those workers who were employed at the time of the
interview in year t 1, unemployed in tand employed at the time of the interview
in year t+1. Further, we deﬁne the within-employer occupational mobility rate as the
fraction of workers employed who did not change employers but exhibit a different
occupational code between years tand t+1, divided by the number of employed
workers who did not change employers between years tand t+1. Similarly, we
deﬁne the across-employer occupational mobility rate be the fraction of employed
workers who’s occupational code differs between years tand t+1 and reported an
employer change between these years, divided by the number of employed workers
in year twho have reported an employer change between years tand t+1. To
identify employer changes we follow the procedure detailed in Kambourov and
Manovskii (2009), Appendix A1.

The left panel of Figure 19 depicts the yearly overall occupational mobility rate
at a one-, two- and three-digit level of aggregation, using the 1970 SOC. When ret-
rospective re-coding was used, the overall occupational mobility rate experienced a
large downward shift, ranging between 10 to 25 percentage points, depending on
the level of aggregation of the occupational codes. These drops suggest that only
between 38% to 45% of all occupational moves are genuine. This is very similar to
the conclusion reached by Kambourov and Manovskii (2008).
The right panel of Figure 19 shows that the within-employer occupational mobil-
ity rates experienced even stronger drops than the overall ones under retrospective
coding. In contrast, the left panel of Figure 20 shows that the impact of coding error
in the across-employer occupational mobility rates is much more moderate and hardly
visible when aggregating occupations at a one-digit level. These results then sug-
gest that the impact of coding error on the overall mobility rates mainly arises from
those workers who did not change employers, where employer stayers account on
average for 87.1% of all employed workers in a given year, while those who changed
employers account for the remainder 12.9%. We ﬁnd a similar conclusion based on
the SIPP data.
Next consider the effects of coding error on the occupational mobility rate of only
those workers who changed employers through a spell of non-employment (ENE).
To construct the ENE occupational mobility rate we consider (i) those workers who
were employed at the interview date in year t 1, non-employed at the interview
date in year tand once again employed at the interview date in year t+1; and

clared a job separation due to “business or plant closing”, due to “being laid off or

details). We divide these ﬂows by the number of workers who changed employ-
ers through a spell of non-employment during the corresponding years. The right
panel of Figure 20 shows that coder error once again seems to have a small effect on
the occupational mobility rates of these workers.
A.3.2 Probabilistic models
The visual impressions given by the above ﬁgures on the effects of coding error
are conﬁrmed when estimating the effects of retrospective coding using a probit or
a linear probability model. In these regressions the dependent variable takes the
value of one if the worker changed occupation and zero otherwise. We include the
indicator variable “break” which takes the value of one during the years in which
the PSID used retrospective coding. In addition we control for age, education, full
or part-time work, occupation of origin, region of residence, aggregate and regional
unemployment rates, a quadratic time trend and number of children.46
46As in Kambourov and Manovskii (2008), the education indicator variable takes the value of one
when the worker has more than 12 years of education and zero otherwise. This is to avoid small
sample problems if we were to divide educational attainment in more categories. The regional un-
employment rates are computed using US states unemployment rates.

Table 21 shows the marginal effects for the probit regressions.47It shows that
retrospective coding had a large and signiﬁcant effect on reducing the probability
of changing occupations when all workers were included in the sample. Further-
more, the values of the marginal effects of the “break” indicator are very close to the
amount by which the overall occupational mobility series shifted when retrospec-
tive coding was used, as depicted in Figure 19.

Our estimates also show that the effect of retrospective coding is much more
moderate when we condition the sample on workers who changed employers and
when we consider the ENE sample.48
A.3.3 A comparison of coding errors across the PSID and SIPP
The point estimates obtained in Table 21 suggest that the probability of an occupa-
tional change for those who changed employers and for those who changed em-
ployer through non-employment spells, should be lowered on average by 3 per-
centage points at a one-digit level, 8 percentage points at a two-digit level and 7
percentage points at a three-digit level to capture the effect of coding error. To com-
pare these estimates to the ones obtained from the SIPP , ﬁrst note that retrospective
coding is done using the same descriptions of the “kind of work” individuals gave
47These estimates are obtained using the personal weights provided by each survey, but similar
results are obtained when using the unweighted data. We also obtained very similar results when
using the linear probability model on weighted and unweighted data and when using robust stan-
dard errors and clustering standard errors at a yearly level.
48We do not include the within-employer occupational mobility in Table 21 because, as suggested
by the graphical analysis, the results are very similar to the ones obtained with the full sample.
99

[Page 101 of 269]
in past interviews and hence captures coding errors introduced at the coding stage
(see Sullivan, 2010). In addition to this coder error, our G-correction method also
takes into account that the source of code disagreement can originate in different
descriptions of the same work (respondent error). Hence we would expect a higher
correction when using the G-correction than when using retrospective coding. Tak-
ing this feature into account and noting that coder error is expected to be the most
important source error (see Mathiowetz, 1992), the PSID estimates compare very
well with the adjustments implied by the G-correction method.
In particular, when aggregating occupations into major categories (2000 SOC or
1990 SOC) and using the G-correction, the corrected average occupational mobil-
ity rate for the non-employed was approximately 11 percentage points lower than
the one obtained using the raw SIPP data. Noting that the occupational aggrega-
tions used in the SIPP and the two-digit aggregation used in the PSID lead to very
similar ENE occupational mobility rates, the 11 percentage point adjustment ob-
tained from the SIPP is thus close to the 8 percentage points suggested by Table
21.49The difference between the adjustments obtained from the SIPP and the PSID
(3 percentage points) then provides a rough estimate of the impact of the respon-
dent error. This estimate then implies that the importance of coder error is about 2.6
times larger than the importance of the respondent error. This is remarkably consis-
tent with Mathiowetz (1992), who shows that the importance of coder error is two
times larger than the importance of the respondent error when aggregating codes at
a one-digit level and ﬁve times larger than the importance of the respondent error
when aggregating codes at a three-digit level.
Furthermore, both the SIPP and the PSID data sets strongly suggest that the per-
centage reduction of occupational mobility due to coding error varies substantially
between employer stayers and employer movers. In the case of employer stayers,
a large percentage of transitions are implied to be spurious. In the PSID we ﬁnd
that at a two-digit level 45% of yearly transitions are spurious, while in the SIPP
we ﬁnd that 40% of the yearly transitions of employer stayers are spurious. In the
case of employer movers, occupational mobility is reduced by about 10 percentage
49For the 1985-1995 period, during which the PSID and SIPP overlap, the average “year-to-year”
occupational mobility rate of the non-employed in the PSID and the SIPP was both around 53.1%
and 47.6% when using the major occupational categories of the 1990 SOC.
100

[Page 102 of 269]
points, but high occupational mobility remains (around 40% comparing before and
after an employer changers), after applying retrospective coding or after using the
G-correction. As discussed earlier, this difference arises as among employer stayers
the proportion of true occupational stayers is high and coding errors translate into a
large amount of spurious mobility. Among those who changed employers through
non-employment there is a much smaller proportion of true occupational stayers
and hence the “population at risk” to be assigned a spurious occupational change is
smaller.50
A.4 Discussion of assumptions A1and A2
We now turn to discuss the two assumptions that appear the most restrictive in our
analysis. As mentioned earlier, assumption A3 is veriﬁed in our data.
A.4.1 Assumption A1
This assumption requires that the realization of an occupational code does not de-
pend on workers’ labor market histories, demographic characteristics or the time it
occurred in our sample. Therefore it implies that errors in the individuals’ verbatim
responses are fully captured by the nature of their job and hence only depend on
their true occupation. It also implies that Gis time-invariant. Since we use these
implications extensively in the implementation of our correction method, we now
investigate them further to help us evaluate the strength of A1. Our main conclusion
is that our Gcorrection method appears to pick up heterogeneity in miscoding across
occupations that is robust to estimations on subsamples of the population. Likewise,
we ﬁnd evidence that even though the Gmatrix was estimated using 1985-1986 data,
it captures well miscoding observed in recent years.
A.4.1.1 Worker heterogeneity
We investigate two aspects of worker heterogeneity that could deliver very different
estimates of G. We ﬁrst consider whether the accuracy of the answer to the occupa-
50vom Lehm et al. (2021) analyses the impact of coding errors on occupational mobility in the CPS
when pooling together movers and stayers and ﬁnd similar results to the ones we derive in the SIPP
for the same pooled sample.
101

[Page 103 of 269]
tion question is affected by differences in workers’ education attainment. A concern
would be that more educated workers can better explain the type of job they are per-
forming and hence coding errors would be less severe among these workers than in
those with lower education. We then consider whether the accuracy of the occu-
pation information is affected by a worker’s interview status. In the SIPP either
the worker reports his/her occupation him/herself to the interviewer (self-report)
or another person of the same household reports his/her occupation (proxy). One
would be concern that proxies answers are more prone to coding error.
Our analysis relies on re-estimating Gusing the 1985-1986 sample but on sub-
samples based on different educational attainment categories and interview status.
As discussed above, the estimation process recovers a transition matrix of purely
spurious mobility, ˆTI
s, (as shown in Table 3 for the 1990 SOC). We can then compare
the estimated matrix of each subsample with the one computed in our main analy-
sis. This comparison allows us to gauge whether the aforementioned characteristics
lead to different miscoding even when conditioning on occupation.
Education differences To study the effect of education differences, we divide the
1985-1986 sample into two groups: (i) high skilled workers which captures all those
individuals with at least some college and (ii) low skilled workers which capture
all those individuals with at most a high school degree. About one-third of the
sample covers high skilled group. Note that occupations and education are highly
correlated in the data. For example, very few non-college-educated workers can be
found in architecture and engineering occupations, while very few college-educated
workers can be found in production and some service occupations. Hence, part of
the impact of education would already be captured by conditioning on occupations.
However, the aim of this exercise is to evaluate the impact of the within-occupation
variation in education on the level of miscoding.
Each panels (a)-(d) of Figure 30b depicts a scatter plot in which on the y-axis are
the elements of the transition matrix ˆTI
sestimated for either the high skilled subsam-
ple (panels (a)-(b)) or the low skilled subsample (panels (c)-(d)) and on the x-axis are
the elements of ˆTI
sestimated in our main analysis. We use the major occupations cat-
egories of the 2000 SOC and depict the same numbering of occupations as in Table
19 for the diagonal elements. Panels (a) and (c) show all the elements of the corre-

sponding matrices, while panels (b) and (d) focus only on the diagonal elements. It
is in the latter where the Gmatrix captures the heterogeneity in the probability of
being coded correctly. Although the correction method formally involves applying
the inverse of G, there is an intuitive relation between the diagonal elements and the
probability of being miscoded. The higher a diagonal element, the lower miscoding
tends to be. Further note that as most of the mass in these transitions matrices lies
on the diagonal elements they will be observed on the top right of the graph, while
the off-diagonal elements will be closer to the origin. For the former we also show
circles around them representing the relative size of the occupations.
If educational differences across workers created very different coding errors, we
would observe large deviations from the 45-degree line. The latter would suggest
important differences between the coding errors obtained in our main analysis and
the ones obtained when taking into account differences in workers’ education. In-
stead, panels (a)-(d) shows that this is not the case. The correlation of coding errors
is very close to one. Using OLS to ﬁt a regression line among the observations, we
observe that the regression line lies nearly on top of the 45-degree line.
Panels (e)-(f) of Figure 30b present a different approach to evaluate the effect
of education differences on coding errors. In this case we only consider, for each
occupation, the observations of those workers with the most dominant education
(more than 50%) in that occupation. That is, we counterfactually impose the coding
error attributed to the dominant education group on all workers in such an occupa-
tion. As before, if educational differences have meaningful effects on coding errors,
controlling for occupations, then we would observe the regression line diverge sig-
niﬁcantly from the 45-degree line. Instead, we once again observe that these lie very
close to each other, with only a slight deviation due to the diagonal elements (see
also Table 22 below).
Interview status differences To investigate the impact of differences in the in-
terview status of a worker on miscoding, we divide the 1985-1986 sample into those
who were interviewed in person (self-interviewed) in two consecutive waves and
those who had their information given by a proxy (proxy interview) at least in one
of the waves. This divides the sample roughly in half: 55% were interviewed in
person and 45% involve a proxy interview.

Figure 22: Comparing the estimated spurious transition matrices by interview status
Figure 22 presents the same scatter plot exercises as describe above, but this time
using the interview status instead of education attainment. We can observe a very
high correlation between the elements of the transition matrix ˆTI
sfor each of these
subsamples and of the transition matrix ˆTI
sestimated in our main analysis. In this
case the regression line is also nearly on top of the 45-degree line, with a very slight
deviation at the diagonal elements. This deviation implies that for those interviewed
in person the slope is a little steeper than one, while it is a little lower than one for
those interviewed by proxy. This captures that the self-interviewed appear slightly
more accurate, with slightly less spurious mobility, than the proxy interviewed.
Nevertheless, in both cases we obtained a very similar conclusion. Occupations
105
----------------------------------------

[Page 107 of 269]
like managers, business and ﬁnancial operators, computer and mathematical occu-
pations and physical scientists are more prone to miscoding; while occupations like
education, training and library occupations, food services and protective services
are less prone to miscoding.
One could further subdivide the analysis using the interaction between educa-
tion and interview status categories to gain a further insight. However, the above
analysis suggests that we would ﬁnd once again that subdividing the sample into
these categories would not meaningfully change our estimated ˆTI
sand hence Gma-
trix.
Implications for measured occupational mobility Table 22 summarises the
above results, showing that the overall level of occupational staying among true
stayers estimated across all subsamples is very similar to the one estimated in our
main analysis. The correlations when using all elements of the matrices are nearly
one. As mentioned above these correlations drop but still remain very high when
only considering the diagonal elements. That is, the Gmatrix capture miscoding
differences across occupation that is present (i) whether the individual is the one
being interviewed or a proxy provides his/her information and (ii) across education
categories.51

Next we apply the implied Gobtained for each of the above subgroup of work-
51Interestingly, high skilled workers are a bit more likely to be miscoded than low skilled work-
ers. This could arise as the occupation typically performed by the high skilled are more specialized
than those performed by the low skilled, making miscoding more likely in the former. Indeed the
increased miscoding reﬂects mostly the occupations that typically performed by the high skilled (11
to 29 in the 2000 SOC). These are associated with a 78.1% of occupational stayers in the estimated ˆTI
s,
while the proportion of occupational staying in the occupations typically performed by low skilled
workers (31 to 53 in the 2000 SOC) is 83.7%. If we were only to consider the high skilled in all oc-
cupations we ﬁnd 79.9% of occupational staying, while if we only consider the low skilled in all
occupations we obtain 82.8% of occupational staying.

ers to correct the mobility-duration proﬁle documented in Section 2.2 of the main
text. Figure 23a considers the mobility-duration proﬁles when using the Gmatrices
obtained from high skilled and low skilled workers. Figure 23b considers the same
mobility-duration proﬁle but this time using the Gmatrices obtained from the self
and proxy interviewed. In both graphs we depict the uncorrected mobility duration

Figure 23: Corrected Mobility-Duration Proﬁle from Gestimated on subsamples
We can observe that when using the Gmatrices from the education attainment
subsamples the implied mobility-duration proﬁles are very similar to the obtained
in our main analysis. When we use high skilled sample to measure miscoding in
all occupations, including those that have very few college workers in them, the
associated proﬁle is only by 1-1.5 percentage point different from the baseline one.
We also obtain a very similar conclusion when using the low skilled sample across
all occupations. The mobility-duration proﬁle corrected by using only information
on those with the dominant education in a given occupation also track the original
mobility duration proﬁle closely. Moreover, when using the Gmatrices implied by
the self-interviewed or proxy subsamples, we once again obtain mobility-duration
proﬁles that hardly differ from the one obtained in our main analysis. This evidence
thus suggests that differences in education attainment or interview status (or their
interaction) do not affect the conclusion obtained from our main correction analy-
sis: occupational mobility is high, a little over 40%, and increases moderately with
unemployment duration.

[Page 109 of 269]
A.4.1.2 Time invariance of G
As previously discussed we estimate the Gcorrection matrix using the 1985-1986
SIPP panels and then apply it to occupational mobility data up to 2014. An impor-
tant concern that arises from this application is whether the estimated coding errors
remain relevant in the later years of our sample as implied by assumption A1. To
directly evaluate whether this is the case we would need to re-apply our correction
method at a later date and compare the more recent coding error correction ma-
trix to our baseline one. To perform this exercise we will require a US data set that
switched from dependent to independent interviewing with respect to occupations
in the 2000s. However, we are not aware of any data set in which this re-design
took place. Due to this barrier we instead take a different approach. We consider a
group of workers who are likely occupation stayers, but coded independently such
that some of them would be observed as occupational movers. We then evaluate
the extent to which our Gmatrix can predict these workers’ observed occupational
mobility, particularly in more recent years. A high predictive power would suggest
that coding errors estimated using data from 1985-1986 remain relevant throughout
our sample.
Motivated by Fujita and Moscarini (2017) we use temporary laid-off workers
to approximate this group of occupational stayers. These authors’ empirical work
suggests that workers in temporary layoff have a very low chance of an occupation
switch once recalled by their previous employers. Therefore it is not unreasonable
to assume that this set of workers are largely made up of true occupation stayers and
can provide a good approximation to the latter group. Instead of using the SIPP
to measure temporary layoffs (as Fujita and Moscarini, 2017), however, we use the
Current Population Survey (CPS). The main reason for this choice is that dependent
interviewing in the CPS only applies when a person is employed both in the cur-
rent month and the month before (see e.g. the CPS interviewing manual 2015). This
implies that workers who are unemployed on temporary layoff will have their occu-
pations coded independently. In contrast, as interviews in the SIPP are conducted
every four months, one cannot guarantee that temporary layoffs with spells of un-
employment of at most 4 months will have their occupations independently coded
at re-employment.

Table 23: Correlations Observed Transition Matrix of Temporary Layoffs with Spu-
rious Transitions (from G)
Therefore, if the vast majority of temporary layoffs are independently-coded true
occupation stayers and theGcoding errors persist over time, we would observe
a positive correlation between the elements of the transition matrix ˆTI
sestimated
in our main analysis and the elements of the observed transition matrix of those
workers returning to work out of a temporary layoff, even if we consider tempo-
rary layoffs three decades later. Table 23 presents the results of such an exercise
using several time periods post the CPS 1994-redesign. The ﬁrst two columns re-
fer to all those workers who were in temporary layoff for less than 13 weeks before
re-employment; while the second two columns refers to the subset of temporary
layoffs with less than 13 weeks in unemployment what were also observed as in-
dustry stayers at re-employment when considering a 3-digit industry aggregation.
Although the latter group reduces the sample size, it is more likely to contain true
occupational stayers. This occurs as occupation and industry mobility tends to go
hand in hand. We return to this point below.52
Across both samples of temporary layoffs Table 23 shows the correlation between
their observed occupational transition matrix and ˆTI
s, obtained from the 1985-1986
SIPP data, when using the 2000 SOC. One can immediately see the very high cor-
relations in the observed occupational mobility patterns among those in temporary
layoff and the one implied by the Gmatrix. Moreover, the value of the correlation is
nearly unchanged over time even when focusing on the years 2014-2021, the period
after our SIPP analysis ended. In particular, the correlations are nearly one when
taking all elements of the matrices (or, very similar but not shown here, all cells
52The post-1994 sample size is about 45,000 for all temporary layoffs with duration less than 13
weeks and about 30,000 for temporary layoffs who are industry stayers. The decadal samples (1994-
2004, 2004-2014, 2014-2021) are about 1/3 of these numbers.

with positive probabilities). Note, however, that some degree of positive correlation
may not be unexpected for this exercise, as the diagonal of both matrices will un-
surprisingly consists of numbers closer to one, while some other cells will naturally
be closer or equal to zero. Therefore, a more stringent test is to consider the corre-
lation only of the diagonal elements. Here we once again observe high correlations
(r>0.7 across all periods). Indeed coding errors according to the Gmatrix explain
about two-thirds of the variance of heterogeneity on the diagonal of occupational
transition of temporary layoffs in the second half of the CPS sample ( r=0.80).

Figure 24: Comparing temporary layoffs in the CPS with the spurious transition
matrix from the SIPP
Figure 24 displays the same exercise as in the previous section, where we now
depict the values of each element of the occupation transition matrix of temporary
layoffs on the y-axis relative to the associate value of the transition matrix implied
byG. The top row considers all temporary layoffs (unemployed for less than 13
weeks), while the bottom row considers the subgroup of temporary layoffs that are
also industry stayers. We observe that the same occupations most prone to miscod-
ing according to Gare also the ones observed among temporary layoffs: managers,
110
----------------------------------------

[Page 112 of 269]
business and ﬁnancials operations, computer and math occupations, and physical
sciences. Conversely, many of the occupations that are least likely to be miscoded
according to Gare also the ones among temporary layoffs: healthcare practitioners,
protective services, food preparation services and above all educators. Figures 24.b
and Figure 24.d consider temporary layoffs for the more recent period 2014-2021
and show that these patterns are largely maintained over time (if a bit more noisy).
Some caveats Even if coding mistakes were completely persistent, the compari-
son between the observed transition matrix of temporary layoffs and our correction
matrix may be affected by other factors not considered in the previous section.
First, and perhaps most importantly, the comparison of the occupational tran-
sitions behind Gwith those of temporary layoffs relies on the assumption that the
latter set of workers captures both the whole set of occupation stayers (and its mis-
coding), but simultaneously no other type of worker, i.e. true movers. Deviations
from this requirement will likely lower the observed correlation. One way to in-
vestigate the presence of true movers among temporary layoffs is to consider their
amount of net mobility – as miscoding inﬂates excess mobility rather than net mobil-
ity. When considering all temporary layoffs, the average net occupational mobility
rate (as deﬁned in Section 2.3 of the paper) is signiﬁcantly lower for these workers
than for all the unemployed, only about 1/3 of the latter. If we assume that true
gross mobility and net mobility move roughly in proportion, this would suggest
that a much larger share of temporary layoffs are true stayers. However, since net
mobility does not drop to zero, some true mobility must remain. The latter seems a
likely explanation of why, even though the top row of Figure 24 shows a high corre-
lation between the two transition matrices, the slope of the regression line lies a bit
further from the 45-degree line relative to the cases studied in Section 4.1.1. How-
ever, if we focus on the subgroup of temporary layoffs that are also industry stayers
we ﬁnd that their average net occupational mobility rate drops by another third rel-
ative to all temporary layoffs.53This strongly suggests that among this subgroup
of temporary layoff workers the vast majority are indeed occupational stayers and
hence provide a more accurate way to evaluate the persistence of the coding errors
53Note that in theory, it could be the case that a spurious occupation change correlates with the
realization of a spurious industry change, something not ruled by assumption A1.
111
----------------------------------------

[Page 113 of 269]
inG. Consistent with this conclusion, we observe in the bottom row of Figure 24 that
the regression line of temporary layoffs who are also three-digit industry stayers lies
much closer to the 45-degree line.54
Second, there may be some differences between the CPS and SIPP that affect the
occupational information and its coding, e.g. (slight) differences in the questions
about occupations.55Given many similarities in terms of occupations across both
surveys (and across time), we expect this factor not to be of great importance. Third,
there may be ﬁnite sample considerations. The sample sizes of the 10-year CPS
windows are lower than the sample on which the Gis estimated in the SIPP (see
footnote 15 and Section 1.3, respectively). We observe some indication that for the
smaller CPS 10-year windows, the sample size may leave some role for ﬁnite sample
noise. In particular, the overall correlation of the temporary layoff transition matrix
over 1994-2020 is higher (at 0.843) than the correlation with respect to the underlying
subsets 1994-2004, 2004-2014, 2014-2020 (around 0.80).
Having highlighted these factors, it is noteworthy that the coding error correc-
tion matrix estimated in the 1985-1986 SIPP panels can explain between half and
two-thirds of the variance along the diagonal of the transition matrix of temporary
layoffs, even in the last decade. These high correlations occur even though the set of
workers in the SIPP behind Gand the temporary layoffs in the CPS are in a very dif-
ferent labor market situation (and formally even in a different employment status).
Overall, this suggests that when using the G-implied miscoding correction we gain
a much better sense of miscoding, beyond a simple uniform level adjustment ap-
plied evenly across all occupation (which by construction has zero correlation with
heterogeneity on the diagonal of spurious occupational mobility transition matrix).
Implications for measured occupational mobility As a ﬁnal exercise we use
the observed occupational transition matrix of the subset of workers who were
54As noted before, to the extent that some realizations of spurious industry mobility correlate with
realizations of spurious occupation mobility (which is not ruled out by assumption A1), we may
have restricted our sample too much to fully satisfy the condition that a representative set of true
occupational stayers are included. However, the difference between the regression line and the 45-
degree line remains small.
55For example, in case the interviewee reports an occupation description that the CPS considers
to be too general, the interviewer follows up by providing a list of more speciﬁc occupations from
which the interviewee should chose from (Appendix 2 of the CPS Manual, 2015). Standard SIPP
documentation does not report a similar routing.

on temporary layoff and observed as industry stayers instead of the Gmatrix in
order to correct the occupational mobility-duration proﬁle of the unemployed in
our SIPP sample. We consider this subset of workers as they have the largest pro-
portion of true occupational stayers and provide a more accurate comparison with
the mobility-duration proﬁle derived from the Gmatrix. Figure 25 shows that the
two corrected proﬁles are nearly indistinguishable, particularly during the ﬁrst six
month of the unemployment spell. This occurs irrespectively of whether we con-
sider all industry-staying temporary layoffs as the base for the correction matrix, or
focus on the subperiods 2004-2014, or even 2014-2021. In all these cases we ﬁnd a
high occupational mobility rate that increases moderately with unemployment du-
ration as we did in our main analysis.
Taken together, the above evidence strongly suggests that the Gcoding errors do
remain relevant even in the 2010s.
A.4.2 Assumption A2
This assumption requires that the number of workers whose true occupation igets
mistakenly coded as jand the number of workers whose true occupation jgets mis-
takenly coded as iand is needed to derive equation (8) and solve for G. Although
this assumption is clearly strong, it is important to note it is a weaker version of
the one proposed by Keane and Wolpin (2011) and subsequently used in the struc-
tural estimation of discrete choice models. In particular, Roys and Taber (2017) used
this assumption to correct for occupation classiﬁcation error. They require that the
113
----------------------------------------

[Page 115 of 269]
number of workers whose true occupation igets mistakenly coded as occupation j
is independent of iand jfor all i6=jand given by a constant. This implies that in
their “garbling” matrix all off-diagonal elements are the same. In contrast, our ap-
proach allows (and recovers) different off-diagonal elements in G, showing the large
heterogeneity in bilateral occupation miscoding (see also Sullivan, 2009).

Unfortunately, we cannot directly test assumption A2 in our SIPP data. Instead,
we can investigate whether there is evidence of an important implication of A2:
coding errors do not change the distribution of occupations across workers. The
PSID retrospective coding exercise is suitable for this exercise as it provides cleaned
occupations codes for workers during the period 1968-1980, but does not correct for
coding errors in the occupations assigned to the same workers during the period
1981-1997. Assumption A2 would imply that we should not observe any signiﬁcant
change in the contribution of each individual occupation across these two periods
after controlling for time trends.
Table 24 reports the results of regressing the contribution of a given occupation
across the period 1968-1997 on the “break” indicator and cubic polynomial time
trend.56We can observe that classiﬁcation errors across occupational coding do not
seem to meaningfully change the distribution of occupation across our PSID sample.
We observe that the break indicator is nearly zero and not statistically signiﬁcant, ex-
cept for the unskilled laborer occupation. However, even in this case the effect of
56Using higher order polynomials generate similar results. We also exclude the categories referring
to armed forces and agricultural occupations as these are not included in our main analysis.
114
----------------------------------------

[Page 116 of 269]
coding error is to decrease the contribution by an average of only 0.85%. Consider-
ing that this is a small occupation, contributing 4.20% in 1980 and 3.60% in 1981, the
effect of coding error in this respect does not seem to be of ﬁrst order importance.

Supplementary Appendix B: Occupational Mobility in
the Data
In this Appendix we investigate in detail the occupational mobility patterns of
those workers who changed employers through spells of unemployment, comple-
menting the empirical patterns documented in the paper. Section 1 documents
the gross occupational mobility - unemployment duration proﬁle. We show that
gross occupational mobility is high and increases moderately with spell duration
when considering different occupation classiﬁcations and types of non-employment
spells. We also show that this proﬁle is widely shared among demographic groups
and individual occupations. The main message of Section 1 is that the aggregate
mobility-duration proﬁle documented in the main text is notdriven by composi-
tion effects whereby some demographic groups and/or individual occupations are
characterised by high mobility rates and short unemployment spells while, simul-
taneously, others are characterised by low mobility rates and longer unemployment
spells. This ﬁnding motivates the assumption in our theoretical model of a common
idiosyncratic ( z-productivity) process shared across different occupations.
Section 2 investigates the extent to which excess and net mobility drive gross
occupational mobility, once again using different alternative classiﬁcations and non-
employment spells. The main message here is that excess occupational mobility
is the main force behind the above gross occupational mobility - unemployment
duration proﬁle. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd a clear pattern in the net mobility ﬂows that
is consistent with the job polarisation literature. These ﬁndings motivate the way
we model workers’ occupational choice in our theoretical model.
Section 3 investigates the cyclical patterns of occupational mobility among un-
employed workers. We document that gross occupational mobility is procyclical.
This pattern is present not only in the average mobility rate but also along the en-
tire occupational mobility - unemployment duration proﬁle. Here we show that the
cyclicality of gross occupational mobility does not depend on occupational classiﬁ-
cations or the inclusion of non-employment spells and that it is also present when
controlling for demographic characteristics and individual occupation ﬁxed effects.
We also show that the procyclicality of gross occupational mobility is driven by
117
----------------------------------------

[Page 119 of 269]
excess mobility. In contrast, we document that net occupational mobility is counter-
cyclical, once again showing a cyclical pattern consistent with the job polarisation
literature.
Section 4 investigates the aggregate hazard functions of the unemployed and the
non-employed in our sample. Our deﬁnition of unemployment implies that these
hazard functions exhibit negative duration dependence but the degree of duration
dependence is small. We then show that occupational movers take longer to leave
unemployment than occupational stayers and that this difference increases in reces-
sions and decreases in expansions. We argue that the difference in unemployment
durations between movers and stayers is related to the process of mobility itself and
not due to occupational or demographic composition effects.
In Section 5 we use the CPS and PSID to further investigate the extent and cycli-
cality of gross occupational mobility among the non-employed. Section 6 constructs
occupational mobility rate using self-reported occupational and job tenure data ob-
tained from the topical modules of the SIPP . The advantage here is that the infor-
mation on occupational change does not use occupational codes, but relies on the
workers own judgement of ‘occupation’, ‘kind of work’ or ‘line of work’. Once again
we ﬁnd that gross occupational mobility among the unemployed is high and pro-
cyclical, increasing moderately with non-employment duration. Section 7 present
the details of the data construction.
B.1 The occupational mobility - unemployment dura-
tion proﬁle
Here we analyse the long-run relationship between occupational mobility and un-
employment duration observed during the 1983-2013 period. We refer to this rela-
tion as the occupational mobility - unemployment duration proﬁle or the mobility-
duration proﬁle for short. We provide further support to one of our main empirical
ﬁndings: the extent of occupational mobility among those workers who changed
employers through spells of unemployed is high and increases moderately with the
duration of the unemployment spell. We use ‘moderately’ to indicate that at least
40% of long-duration unemployed workers return to their previous major occupa-
118
----------------------------------------

[Page 120 of 269]
tion upon re-employment. We show that this pattern holds under alternative oc-
cupational classiﬁcations and when aggregating major occupations into task-based
categories (see Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). This pattern also holds when consider-
ing non-employment spells instead of just unemployment spells, and can be found
within gender, education and age groups as well as at the level of individual occu-
pations. These ﬁndings are important as they counter concerns that the aggregate
mobility-duration proﬁle is driven by differences in the demographic or occupa-
tional composition of the outﬂows from unemployment at different durations. This
suggests that there is a common underlying process shared across these subgroups
which leads long-duration unemployed workers to be still signiﬁcantly attached to
their previous occupation.
Table 25 reports the estimated mobility-duration proﬁles across occupational cat-
egories and demographic groups. In particular, panel A reports the G-corrected
mobility-duration proﬁle, where the ﬁrst row shows the average occupational mo-
bility rates over all unemployment (non-employment) spells and the second row
reports the OLS estimate of the linear relation between completed unemployment
duration and occupational mobility, bdur. To estimate the latter we compute the raw
occupation transition matrix of all workers with the same unemployment duration.
We then apply to this matrix our G-correction and compute the average corrected oc-
cupational mobility rate. This is done for each month of completed unemployment
duration between 1 and 14 months. We estimate bdurby regressing the set of aver-
age mobility rates on completed duration, weighing each monthly observation by
the number of workers in the corresponding duration group (which itself involves
summing the person weights by month).
Panel B reports the uncorrected mobility-duration proﬁle in the same fashion as
in panel A. However, since in the uncorrected data we can use individual workers’
unemployment spells to estimate bdur, we regress the following linear probability
model (probits give nearly identical results)
1occmob =b0+bdurduration of U (or N) spell +#, (R1)
where 1occmob is a binary indicator that takes the value of one (zero) if a worker
changed (did not change) occupation at the end of his/her unemployment (non-
employment) spell, “duration of U (or N) spell” is the individual’s completed un-
119

employment (non-employment) spell and #is the error term. The advantage of the
individual-level uncorrected data is that we can take into account worker’s char-
acteristics and evaluate their role in shaping the mobility-duration proﬁle. This is
done in panels C, D and E.
Column (1) of Table 25 presents our benchmark result which is based on ma-
jor occupational groups of the 2000 Census Classiﬁcation of Occupations (or 2000
SOC). To consistently use the 2000 SOC throughout the period of study, we applied
the IPUMS homogenisation procedure to convert previous classiﬁcations used in
the SIPP . The 2000 SOC has 23 major occupational groups as its most aggregated
classiﬁcation, which we further reduce to 21 as we leave “army” and “agricultural
occupations” out of our sample.
Figure 26a depicts the mobility-duration proﬁle using this occupational classi-
ﬁcation, but based on an alternative formulation. Namely, for a given unemploy-
ment duration x, the ﬁgure depicts gross occupational mobility as the fraction of
workers who had at least xmonths in unemployment and changed occupation at
re-employment among those workers who had at least xmonths in unemployment
before regaining employment. This way of presenting the proﬁle allows to read di-
rectly from the graph the average occupational mobility rate of the sample of work-
ers who had completed unemployment durations of at least xmonths. In what
follows every time we graph the mobility-duration proﬁle, we will be using this
alternative formulation.
In both the table and ﬁgure the average ( G-corrected and uncorrected) probabil-
ity of an occupational change is high and increases moderately with unemployment
duration. Further, note that the slope of the mobility-duration proﬁle is slightly
steeper with the corrected measures. This arises as miscoding (and hence spurious
mobility) is more common among observations with short unemployment dura-
tions. The G-correction will then adjust more the shorter than the longer duration
spells and yield a steeper proﬁle relative to the uncorrected data. Also with con-
siderably more short than long spells in the sample, the regression coefﬁcient on
duration is more representative of the slope at short completed durations.
The rest of the columns of Table 25 present the results for a number of different
ways of classifying occupational mobility. Column (2) uses instead the major oc-
cupational groups of the 1990 Census Classiﬁcation of Occupations (or 1990 SOC).

Columns (3) to (5) aggregate occupations into task-based categories. Column (6)
considers the case of simultaneous occupational and industry mobility as an alter-
native way to minimise the effects of coding errors in the occupational mobility
rates. Column (7) considers industry mobility, as a comparison to occupational mo-
bility. Column (8) uses the major groups of the 2000 SOC but instead considers
non-employment spells that contain at least one month of unemployment (‘NUN’-
spells). We now discuss each one in turn. We then discuss the effects of worker
demographics characteristic and the role of individual occupations.

B.1.1 Gross occupational mobility under alternative occupational
classiﬁcations
1990 Census Classiﬁcation of Occupations The 2000 SOC provided a major
revision of the 1990 SOC as a response to the changing structure of jobs in the US.
The major difference between these two classiﬁcations relies on the former grouping
occupations based on the concept of “job families” by placing individuals who work
together in the same occupational group. The result was that some occupations
that belonged to different groups in the 1990 SOC were pulled together in the 2000
SOC revision. This led to an increase in the size of occupations like “professional”,
“technical”, “management” and “services”.
Inﬂuential work, however, relies on the 1990 SOC to understand occupational
change in the US (see Autor and Dorn, 2013, among others). To verify that our con-
clusions are not affected by the type of classiﬁcation used, we compute the mobility-
duration proﬁle based on the 1990 SOC. In this case we apply the homogenisation
procedure proposed by Autor and Dorn (2013). The 1990 SOC provides 13 major oc-
cupational groups from which we aggregate the services related occupations (“pro-
tective services”, “private households” and “others”) into one single major group.
We do this as the “protective services” and “private households” occupations are
very small in size. At the same time we expand the “precision, production, craft
and repair” into three new major groups: “precision production”, “mechanics and
repair” and “construction trade occupations”. This allows us to evaluate “construc-
tion” as a separate group.
Column (2) of panel B in Table 25 shows that in the uncorrected data we ob-
tain nearly identical results when using the 2000 SOC or the 1990 SOC. Applying
theG-correction yields a slightly lower average mobility rate and a slightly larger
duration coefﬁcient when using the 1990 SOC. Despite these differences, Figure 26
shows the mobility-duration proﬁles and the associate 95% conﬁdence intervals on
uncorrected data. It shows that long-duration unemployed with completed spells
of at least 9 months change occupations in 53% of cases in both the 1990 and 2000
classiﬁcations.

Routine vs Non-Routine, Cognitive vs Manual Occupational Categorization
A related set of important work has documented a pattern of job polarization dur-
ing our period of study (1983-2013). This pattern is characterised by a decline in the
employment shares and levels of occupations that have a high content of routine
tasks (see Autor et al., 2003, Goos and Manning, 2007, and Acemoglu and Autor,
2011, among others). Although at the heart of this evidence lies the changing di-
rection of net ﬂows across occupations (a topic we address in Section 2 below), it
is important for our study to ﬁrst investigate whether the mobility-duration proﬁle
documented above is also observed when aggregating the major occupations into
the task-based categories suggested by the job polarization literature. In particular,
we aggregate the 13 major occupational groups of the 1990 SOC into routine manual
(RM), non-routine manual (NRM), routine cognitive (RC) and non-routine cognitive
(NRC).
Column (3) of Table 25 shows the estimates based on the RM/NRM/RC/NRC
grouping. In this case we follow Cortes et al. (2016) and deﬁne the RM occupa-
tions to be (i) “precision production”, (ii) “machine operators and assemblers”, (iii)
“mechanics and repairers”, (iv) “laborers and helpers”, (v) “transportation and ma-
terial moving” and (vi) “construction and extractive”. The NRM occupations to be
the “service occupations”. The RC occupations to be (i) “sales occupations” and (ii)
“administrative support and clerical occupations”. The NRC occupations to be (i)
“management occupations”, (ii) “professional specialties” and (iii) “technicians and
123

related support occupations”.
Column (4) considers an alternative classiﬁcation in which we move the “trans-
portation and material moving” occupation to the NRM group (see Autor et al.,
2003). This is done mainly because this occupation exhibits a low routine-intensity
score. Table 26 illustrates this feature by reporting the average routine task-intensity
(together with the abstract and manual task intensity) of each major occupation of
the 2000 SOC, using the occupation-task intensity crosswalk of Autor and Dorn
(2013). Its third column reports the average routine task intensity of the pre-separation
three-digit occupation held by unemployed workers. It is clear that “transportation
and material moving” has one of the lowest routine task-intensity scores.57Ad-
ditional reasons to include “transportation and material moving” into the NRM
groups are that this occupation exhibits net inﬂows, while the other conventional
RM occupations are net losers of workers; and that it also behaves cyclically similar
to other NRM occupations.
Table 25 shows that under both task-based categorizations the average occupa-
tional mobility rates is high: 26% (33%) and 29% (35%) of all unemployment spells
in the G-corrected (uncorrected) data involved workers changing task-based occu-
pational categories. It also shows that the duration coefﬁcient implies a modestly
increasing proﬁle. Figures 27a and 27b present the mobility-duration proﬁles and
the associate conﬁdence intervals. It shows that workers who had unemployment
spells of at least 9 months experience about a 34% and 37% probability of chang-
ing task-based groups. Figure 27c shows the mobility-duration proﬁle by assigning
“transportation and material moving” into the NRM category, using the 2000 SOC.
Once again we observe that choosing the 2000 SOC or the 1990 SOC to classify oc-
cupations makes little difference.
Column (5) of Table 25 presents the results for another task-based classiﬁcation.
In this case we merge the routine cognitive and non-routine cognitive categories
together, to focus on transitions between routine manual and non-routine manual,
relative to all other (cognitive) occupations. This aggregation is motivated by the
observed direction of the net ﬂows across the task-based occupations, which we
discuss in detail in Section 2. It aims to highlight the disappearance of routine man-
57A similar ranking occurs when using the 1990 SOC. We use the 2000 SOC in Table 26 to refer
back to the results presented in the main text, which are based in the latter classiﬁcation.

ual jobs and the rise of non-routine manual jobs as a key feature of unemployed
workers’ occupational mobility, and reduce the role of “management occupations”
which accounts for the vast majority of net outﬂows from non-routine cognitive
occupations. Nevertheless, we again observe that, even with this very coarse sub-
division, there remains substantial occupational mobility (over 20%) which mod-
estly increases with unemployment duration. Figure 27d presents graphically the
mobility-duration proﬁle and the associate conﬁdence intervals.

B.1.2 Industry Mobility, and Simultaneous Occupation and Indus-
try Mobility
Next we consider the case of simultaneous occupational and industry mobility as an
alternative way to minimise the effects of coding errors in the occupational mobility
rates in the raw data. This approach follows Neal (1999), Moscarini and Thomsson
(2007), Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) and Pavan (2011), and it is based on the
assumption that workers who are observed changing occupations, are more likely
to be true movers when they are also observed changing employers and industries.
Column (4) of Table 25 shows the average mobility rate and duration coefﬁcient
for the sample of workers for which we have valid (and non imputed) occupation
and industry information. In this case we use the major occupational groups of the
2000 SOC and the 15 major industry groups of the 1990 Census Bureau industrial
classiﬁcation system. Since simultaneous occupational and industry mobility can be
taken as an alternative measure of true occupational mobility (see references above),
we report this measure both in panels A and B without any further adjustment.
Once again we observe that the extent of occupational mobility among those who
changed employers through spells of unemployed is high and increases moderately
with unemployment duration.
The mobility-duration proﬁle obtained from simultaneous occupational and in-
dustry mobility is depicted in Figure 28a, together with the G-corrected mobility-
duration proﬁle depicted in Figure 26a for comparison and the associate conﬁdence
intervals. The former shows that about 38% of workers who had unemployment
spells of at least one month changed major occupations and industries at re-employment,
while about 46% of workers who had unemployment spells of at least 9 months
changed major occupations and industries at re-employment. These rates are around
5 percentage points lower but not too dissimilar from the ones obtained from the
G-corrected proﬁle for occupational mobility. This suggests that conditioning on si-
multaneous industry and occupational transitions can provide a useful alternative
to gauge the level of gross occupational mobility rates.
Caution is advised, however, when constructing statistics that lean more heavily
on occupational identities or capture measurement of change in occupational mo-
bility rates. When using the occupation/industry cross-product to inform true oc-

cupational mobility, two mistakes will be made. (i) True occupational movers who
are true industry stayers will be mistakenly left aside. This issue might be more
prevalent in some occupations and less so in others, and hence can unevenly affect
the measurement of net mobility. For this reason, in what follows we will use simul-
taneous industry and occupation transitions to construct gross mobility rates and
not net mobility measures. (ii) For true industry movers who are also true occupa-
tional stayers, there will be a (on average) 20% probability of mistakenly considering
them as simultaneous occupation and industry movers. It is not clear whether the
size of these two types of errors will stay constant when, for example, measuring
differences between subsamples with different true mobility rates.58Nevertheless,
it is evident that the simultaneous mobility measure also indicates a high level of
occupational mobility that moderately increases with unemployment duration.
Column (5) of Table 25 report the G-corrected and the uncorrected average mobil-
ity rates and the duration coefﬁcients of workers who changed employers through
unemployment, using only the 15 major industry groups of the 1990 Census Bureau
industrial classiﬁcation system. Figure 28b also presents the G-corrected and the
uncorrected mobility-duration proﬁles. This evidence conﬁrms that many unem-
58It is relatively straightforward to verify that the (uncorrected) slope of the mobility-duration
proﬁle can suffer from attenuation bias arising from miscoding. While our G-corrections pushes
against this bias, this does not seem to be the case when using the simultaneous mobility measure.
In this case we observe that the mobility-duration proﬁle has a somewhat lower slope than both
the raw occupational and industrial mobility-duration proﬁles, and therefore even lower than the
G-corrected slopes.
128
----------------------------------------

[Page 130 of 269]
ployed workers also changed industries at re-employment. In the uncorrected data
we observe that around 53% of workers who had unemployment spells of at least a
month changed industries at re-employment, while about 60% of workers who had
unemployment spells of at least 9 months changed industries at re-employment.
These rates are remarkably close to the raw occupational mobility rates reported in
columns (1) and (2). The G-correction mobility-duration proﬁle of industry mobility,
however, drops by less than the occupation proﬁles, with an average mobility of
48.5%. This is consistent with the well-known fact that industry mobility rates are
less prone to measurement error than occupational mobility rates (as also reported
in Table 5 of Supplementary Appendix A).
B.1.3 Occupational mobility through non-employment spells
The above analysis restricts attention to non-employment spell in which workers
where unemployed every month, categorised as “no job/business - looking for
work or on layoff” in the SIPP . We now consider the case in which workers spend
part of their non-employment spell outside of the labor force, categorised as “no
job/business - not looking for work and not on layoff” in the SIPP . This allows us
to investigate whether the mobility-duration patterns documented above are also
present when we include joblessness periods in which workers reported no active
job search. This case also allows us to investigate whether the mobility-duration pro-
ﬁle based on “pure” unemployment spells is driven by a composition effect based
on workers’ differential propensities to drop out of the labor force. In particular,
if workers had ex-ante different propensities to change occupations and if these
propensities were negatively associated with the probability of dropping out of the
labor force after long periods of joblessness (for example, due to discouragement
effects), a restriction to “pure” unemployment spells could be effectively selecting
occupational movers at higher unemployment durations. This would then lead to
a different interpretation of the mobility-duration proﬁle than the one proposed by
our theoretical framework.
To address this concern we compute the mobility-duration proﬁle for workers
with different degrees of labor market attachment: (1) ‘U’ spells, our baseline, where
the individual is “looking for work” every month of the non-employment spell.
129
----------------------------------------

[Page 131 of 269]
(2) ‘UNU’ spells, where the worker starts the non-employment spell “looking for a
work” and ends it also “looking for a work”, but can have intervening months out-
side the labor force. (3) ‘UN’ spells, where the worker starts the non-employment
spell “looking for work” and this can be followed by periods out of the labor force,
before regaining employment (not necessarily reporting unemployment just before
re-employment). (4) ‘NU’ spells, where the worker might or might not be “looking
for work” after separation, but eventually “looks for work” and ﬁnds one shortly
thereafter. (5) ‘N*’ spells, where the worker loses his job for economic reasons tied
in with the job (as indicated by the ‘reason for ending previous job’, or starts looking
for a job when he becomes non-employed.59(6) ‘NUN’ spells, where the worker
“looks for work” at least one month during the non-employment spell. (7) ‘N’
spells, covering all non-employment spells in the sample that are completed within
18 months.

(6) NUN 19,060 47.0 15.9
(7) N 27,931 43.2 16.7
Column (8) of Table 25 reports the average mobility rate and duration coefﬁcient
for the ‘NUN’ case using the major occupation categories of the 2000 SOC. It shows
that the mobility-duration proﬁle is very similar to the one obtained when consider-
ing only unemployment spells in between jobs. Table 27 then compares the ‘NUN’
case with the rest of the cases described above. The ﬁrst column shows the amount
of eligible spells for the 1983-2013 period, where we have arranged the number of
spells in ascending order. The number of eligible spells takes into account that we
do not want to create a bias because of left-censoring. Therefore we only count
those spells that end after more than 16 months into the sample. At the same time
59The reasons we consider in this case are: (i) employer bankrupt, (ii) employer sold business;
(iii) job was temporary and ended, (iv) slack work or business conditions, (v) unsatisfactory work
arrangements (hours, pay, etc), (vi) quit for some other reason. We do not consider: quit to take an-
other job, retirement or old age, childcare problems, other family/personal obligations, own illness,
own injury, school/training.

[Page 132 of 269]
we want to ensure that the relevant observations are not too close to the end of the
panel, at least 1 year away from it, to avoid biases due to right-censoring.60Anal-
ogously to our treatment of unemployment spells, we consider workers to enter
non-employment only if they have not been employed for more than a month.

Figure 29: Extent of mobility by non-employment duration - Gcorrected
The second column of Table 27 shows the G-corrected average occupational mo-
bility rates of all those workers who had at least one month in non-employment
before regaining employment. We can readily observe very similar and high aver-
age occupational mobility rates across different degrees of labor market attachment.
Figure 29 shows the G-corrected mobility-duration proﬁles for all these cases. It is
immediate that these proﬁles are also very similar to each other. Overall, this means
that the concern that our baseline restriction to (pure) unemployment is selecting
occupational movers at long unemployment durations appears not to be supported
by the data. Workers who spend part of their non-employment spell outside the
labor force have very similar mobility-duration proﬁles as those who spend all their
non-employment spell actively looking for work.61
60When controlling for non-/unemployment duration in the regressions, censoring is less of an is-
sue. In that case we use a less stringent selection criterion, and as a result we have more observations,
as can be seen in the ﬁrst line of Table 25.
61Note, however, that including non-employment spells that are spent wholly outside of the labor
force (‘N’ spells), leads to a somewhat steeper mobility-duration proﬁle. This is visible especially
when we consider the non-smoothed observations in Figure 29b. This difference originates entirely
by the set of short completed spells ( three months) in which workers were exclusively out of the
labor force and exhibited a signiﬁcantly lower probability of changing occupation at re-employment.
These short ‘pure N’-spells may reﬂect employer-to-employer moves with a delayed start. After
three months the‘N’ mobility-duration proﬁle then follows the other proﬁles.
131
----------------------------------------

[Page 133 of 269]
Although not shown in the ﬁgure, we also observe that when using non-employment
spells the G-corrected and uncorrected mobility-duration proﬁles relate to each other
in a similar way as documented when using pure unemployment spells. For exam-
ple, in the case of the ‘UNU’ spells we ﬁnd a 7.1 percentage points average differ-
ence between the corrected and uncorrected proﬁles, while for the ‘NUN’ spells the
average difference is of 6.7 percentage points.
B.1.4 Demographics
We now investigate the extent to which different demographic groups have differ-
ent propensities to change occupations and how these propensities change with un-
employment (non-employment) duration. In particular, we want to know whether
there is evidence of a demographic composition effect driving the aggregate mobility-
duration proﬁle. To analyse the impact of demographic characteristics we use the
uncorrected, individual-based, data and augment equation (R1) by including dum-
mies for gender, race and education, a quartic in age, a linear time trend, and dum-
mies for the classiﬁcation used to report occupations (industries) in each panel. The
resulting regression is then given by
1occmob =b0+bdurduration of U (or N) spell +beducdum Education +bracedum Race
+bsexdum Gender +btimeQuarter +bclsdum classiﬁcation +bage(Quartic in Age ) +#,
(R2)
where as a baseline we chose white high school educated male individuals. The
demographic dummies attempt to capture any ﬁxed characteristics that differenti-
ate the average probability of an occupational change across these groups. Further,
if some demographic characteristics are associated with higher (lower) propensi-
ties to move occupations at re-employment and if these propensities are positively
associated with longer (shorter) unemployment durations, the inclusion of the de-
mographic dummies will also capture any composition effects that could be driving
the slope of the mobility-duration proﬁle. Hence signiﬁcant changes to the esti-
mated value of the duration coefﬁcient, bdur, when using equation (R2) instead of
(R1) would suggest that demographic composition effects are at work.
132
----------------------------------------

[Page 134 of 269]
Gender and Education The ﬁrst row of panel C of Table 25 shows that the inclu-
sion of the gender and education dummies do not meaningfully affect the coefﬁcient
on unemployment duration. Across all columns, the point estimates of the duration
coefﬁcient are marginally higher relative to the point estimates in panel B and their
differences are not statistically signiﬁcant. Therefore we do not ﬁnd evidence that
the increase in occupational mobility with unemployment duration is a result of dif-
ferent demographic composition among those that re-gain employment at different
unemployment durations. The rest of the estimated coefﬁcients in panel C show
that the average probability of an occupational change only differs a few percentage
points across gender and education groups. For example, using the 2000 SOC the
average occupational mobility rate of females is 2.1 percentage points higher than
for males; while the average occupational mobility rate of a high school graduate is
around 4.2 percentage points higher than for high school dropouts and 3.4 percent-
age points lower than college graduates.62
Panel D shows the estimates of augmenting equation (R2) by interactions be-
tween the completed unemployment duration, gender and education. This is done
to investigate whether the different demographic groups exhibit different slopes in
their respective mobility-duration proﬁles. The lack of statistical signiﬁcance of the
interaction terms then suggests that the mobility-duration proﬁles speciﬁc to the
gender and educational subgroups exhibit similar slopes. This is further conﬁrmed
in panel E, where we test the joint equality of the duration coefﬁcients across these
demographic groups. We cannot reject that the duration coefﬁcients are equal, even
at higher p-values.
Figure 30 depicts the mobility-duration proﬁles by gender and two education
subgroups. Figure 30a depicts the occupational mobility-duration proﬁle by gender,
while Figure 30b depicts the proﬁles for high school graduates and college grad-
uates. We observe that across these demographics occupational mobility is high,
above 40%. Moreover, although the slope is somewhat stronger for males, the in-
crease of occupational mobility with unemployment duration is moderate, in the
62The exception is the college graduates group in the 3-category task-based classiﬁcation (see col-
umn (8)). This arises because in this case we have aggregated all cognitive occupations, which repre-
sent the bulk of occupations chosen by college graduates, into one task-based group. The remaining
mobility of these workers is therefore mostly into (or from) manual occupations. Around 10% of
college graduates ( G-corrected measure) move across these task-based groups rising to about 15%
for long-term unemployed workers.
133
----------------------------------------

[Page 135 of 269]
sense longer-term unemployed more often change occupations, yet between 45-50%
will still return to the previous occupation, across gender and education.

Figure 30: The mobility-duration proﬁle by gender and education groups
Linear Time Trend The last two rows of panel C of Table 25 shows that the av-
erage occupational mobility rate of the unemployed has been increasing over time.
The estimated coefﬁcients are statistically signiﬁcant and economically meaning-
ful. This is consistent with the rise in overall occupational mobility documented by
Kambourov and Manovskii (2008). As the main focus of our paper is on the cyclical
patterns of occupational mobility, we leave the investigation of these long-run in-
crease for future research. However, we note that controlling for a linear time trend
does not have a major impact on the documented behavior of the mobility-duration
proﬁle and its cyclical responsiveness.
Age groups The most signiﬁcant difference across all the demographic groups
considered is between young and prime-aged workers. We deﬁne young workers as
those who left education (and hence fully entered the labor market) and are between
20-30 years. Prime-aged workers are those workers who are between 35 and 55 years
of age. Figure 31 depicts the uncorrected and G-corrected mobility-duration proﬁles
of these workers.
Panel A of Table 28 reports the average occupational mobility rate of young and
prime-aged workers, after correcting for miscoding. The ﬁrst two rows show that

Figure 31: The mobility-duration proﬁle by age groups
across classiﬁcations the difference between young and prime-aged workers’ av-
erage occupational mobility rates is about 10 percentage points. The second two
rows show that this difference diminishes somewhat with unemployment duration.
The last two rows summarise all this information by showing the ratio between the
occupational mobility rate of those long-term unemployed (with spells of at least 9
months) and the occupational mobility rate of all those unemployed of the same age
group. In particular, we observe that across the different classiﬁcations young work-
ers with unemployment spells of at least 9 months have an occupational mobility
rate that is about 15% higher than the average mobility rate of all young unem-
ployed workers. In the case of prime-aged workers, this ratio is about 20%. Panel B
shows very similar conclusions for the uncorrected data.
Panel C reports the estimated difference between young and prime-aged work-
ers’ average occupational mobility rates obtained from regressing 1occmob on a con-
stant and a dummy that takes the value one if the worker belongs to the prime-age
group and zero otherwise. In this case we restrict to the sample that only contains
either young or prime-aged workers. As in panel A, we ﬁnd that the difference
between the occupational mobility rates of young and prime-aged workers is of
about 10 percentage points. Panel D shows the estimated coefﬁcient of the prime-
age dummy when augmenting this regression with controls for demographic char-
acteristics (gender, race, education) and a linear time trend. In this case we ﬁnd that
adding these additional regressors does not meaningfully affect the estimated dif-

ference between the average occupational mobility rates of young and prime-aged
workers.
The ﬁrst row of panel E reports the estimated coefﬁcient on the prime-age dummy
when augmenting the regression underlying panel D with occupational/industry
controls and interactions between gender, education and race with the prime-age
dummy. In this case we ﬁnd a slightly larger difference between the occupational
mobility rates of young and prime-aged workers, with the exception of the task-
based classiﬁcation. The remainder rows of panel E show the estimated coefﬁ-
cients of the interaction terms. The interaction terms allow us to investigate whether
136
----------------------------------------

[Page 138 of 269]
the lower occupational mobility rate of prime-aged workers can be explain by life-
cycle shifts towards certain occupations, or is concentrated in certain demographic
groups. Given the lack of statistical signiﬁcance of most of the coefﬁcients, we do
not ﬁnd strong evidence for either explanation.63
Panels F and G consider the interaction between age and unemployment dura-
tion. In panel F (G) we add an interaction term between the prime-aged dummy
and unemployment duration to the regression underlying the estimates in panel C
(E). In both cases, we observe that the point estimates indicate a steeper slope for
prime-aged workers, as suggested by the last two rows of panel A. However, the
estimated coefﬁcients are small and are not always statistically signiﬁcant.
B.1.5 Occupation identities
We now turn to investigate whether the aggregate mobility-duration proﬁle is driven
by composition effects at the level of individual occupations. In particular, we want
to know to what extent a subset of occupations is associated with high occupational
mobility rates and longer non-employment durations, while another subset is as-
sociated with lower mobility rates and shorter non-employment durations. If this
were to be the case, one could potentially explain the aggregate mobility-duration
proﬁle as a result of selection effects across occupations.
Figures 32 and 33 (in Section 2) show the average gross occupational mobil-
ity rates by major occupations and task-based occupations together with the cor-
responding overall average occupational mobility rate. The height of each light
colored bar corresponds to the average gross occupation(industry)-speciﬁc mobil-
ity rate, while the width of each bar corresponds to the proportion of the inﬂow into
unemployment that originate from a given occupation (industry). The light colored
horizontal line depicts the G-corrected occupational (industry) mobility rate.
The graphs in Figure 32 show that across the vast majority of occupations (and
industries) the extent of gross mobility is high. The G-corrected occupation-speciﬁc
mobility rate in nearly all occupations is either close or above 40%, covering over
63An exception being for gender in the cases of ‘NUN’ spells, industry mobility and simultaneous
occupation and industry mobility. Here we ﬁnd a drop of 2 to 3 percentage points. Another exception
is for college graduates in the case of the 3 task-based category classiﬁcation. Here all cognitive
occupations are merged into one task-based group, limiting overall occupational mobility and its
responsiveness of college graduates.
137
----------------------------------------

[Page 139 of 269]
80% of all unemployment spells. Figures 53a and 53b use the 2000 SOC and show
that this feature is robust to whether we consider pure unemployment spells or
‘NUN’ spells. Figure 32c shows that this feature is also robust to using the 1990
SOC instead of the 2000 SOC. Figure 32d shows that this feature is also found across
major industries. In both industry and occupations, however, the main exception is
“construction”, which exhibits a mobility rate of around 25%. Figure 33 shows that
gross occupational mobility is also high and nearly identical across all task-based
occupational categories.
To analyse the impact of occupational identities on the slope of the mobility-
duration proﬁle, we estimate regressions of the general form:
1occmob =b0+bduru.duration +boccocc.dum +bage(Quartic in Age ) +bdmdemog.ctrls +#,
(R3)
where “occ.dum” denotes occupation identity dummies and the demographic con-
trols include dummies for gender, education and race. If a subset of occupations
are associated with higher (lower) mobility probabilities and if these probabilities
are positively associated with longer (shorter) unemployment durations, the inclu-
sion of occupation identity dummies will capture composition effects that could
be driving the slope of the aggregate mobility-duration proﬁle. We consider two
cases when evaluating these occupation dummies: (i) source and (ii) destination
occupations. The former are the occupations that were performed by workers im-
mediately before becoming unemployed (non-employed), while the latter are the
occupations to which workers got re-employed into. For comparability, panel A of
Table 29 reports the estimated duration coefﬁcient based on regression (R2) without
occupation identity dummies, as reported in the ﬁrst row of panel C of Table 25. If
signiﬁcant changes to the estimated value of the duration coefﬁcient, bdur, were ob-
served when adding occupation identity dummies, this would suggest the presence
of composition effects across occupations.
Panel B reports the results from regression (R3) based on workers’ source occu-
pations. By comparing the duration coefﬁcients of panels A and B, it is immediate
that across all occupational classiﬁcations the slopes of the mobility-duration proﬁle
are hardly affected when adding source occupation ﬁxed effects. The rest of the co-
efﬁcients in panel B show a similar pattern as the one reported in Table 25. Panel C

Note that the duration coefﬁcients remain virtually identical to the case in which we
use source occupation instead. This suggests that the aggregate mobility-duration
proﬁle does not seem to be a result of selection, whereby those occupations with
high gross occupational ﬂows are also associated with long unemployment dura-
tions.
Panel D further investigates whether the slopes of the mobility-duration proﬁles
are different across source occupations. It reports the results of testing whether the
implied slopes of the mobility-duration proﬁles across source occupations are equal.
Using an F-test, we cannot reject the hypothesis that all slopes are equal, with high
p-values in many cases.64Although not shown here, we also tested whether the
semi-elasticity of the relative increase in occupational mobility associated with a one-
month higher duration is equal across occupations. Once again we ﬁnd that we
cannot reject the hypothesis that they are equal across occupations and this result
64The somewhat lower p-value for the ‘NUN’ measure (0.25) is driven by women in the educa-
tion/library occupational category. Excluding this occupation yields a p-value for equality of slopes
in all remaining occupations of 0.66.

holds for all classiﬁcations and samples used in Table 29.
B.2 Excess and net occupational mobility
In this section we show that excess occupational mobility accounts for the vast ma-
jority of the gross mobility documented in Section 1 and is the main driver of the
mobility-duration proﬁle. We also show that although the extent of net mobility is
small compared to the extent of gross mobility or the overall amount of unemploy-
ment spells, it exhibits a well deﬁned pattern. Consistent with the job polarization
literature we observe that during the 1983-2013 period routine manual occupations
have experienced net outﬂows, while non-routine manual occupations have expe-
rienced net inﬂows. At the same time we ﬁnd that routine cognitive occupations
have experienced net inﬂows, while non-routine cognitive occupations have expe-
rienced net outﬂows. We document the importance of “management” occupations
in driving the net mobility patterns within the set of cognitive occupations.
B.2.1 Net and gross ﬂows per occupation
Figure 32 depicts the G-corrected gross and net occupational mobility per individual
major occupation and industry. The width of each bar corresponds to the proportion
of workers’ unemployment spells that originate from a given occupation (industry)
among all workers’ unemployment spells in our sample. The height of each light
colored bar corresponds to the proportion of workers’ unemployment spells that
originate from a given occupation and that end with an occupational change. That
is, the height of each light colored bar measures the occupation-speciﬁc gross mo-
bility rate. On the other hand, the height of each dark colored bar corresponds to the
proportion of the workers’ unemployment spells that originate from a given occu-
pation that cover the total net ﬂows from that occupation. A positive value for the
height of a dark colored bar refers to inﬂows, while a negative value refers to out-
ﬂows. The area of each light (dark) colored bar then gives the occupation-speciﬁc
gross (net) ﬂows as a proportion of all workers unemployment spells. It is impor-
tant to note that a net ﬂow appears twice on the graph, once as an outﬂow and then
as an inﬂow. It is also important to note that because the SIPP has a longitudinal

[Page 143 of 269]
dimension a workers may have more than one unemployment spell in which he
ends up changing occupation. This is the reason why we describe our measures of
mobility based workers’ unemployment spells. Total net ﬂows are then obtained
as the absolute value of the sum of all occupation-speciﬁc outﬂows, or the sum of
all occupation-speciﬁc inﬂows, or the absolute value of the sum of both divided by
two. Total gross ﬂows are obtained as the sum of all occupation-speciﬁc gross ﬂows.
The dashed lines depict total net ﬂows as a proportion of all unemployment spells.
The light colored line depicts the average gross occupational mobility rate.
It is evident that total gross ﬂows are much larger than total net ﬂows. Using the
2000 SOC, for example, the proportion of all workers unemployment spells in our
sample that cover total net ﬂows is just 4.2%, while the proportion of all workers’
unemployment spells in our sample that cover total gross ﬂows is 44.4% (see Table
25). The proportion of all gross occupational ﬂows that are necessary to generate
the observe net ﬂows between major occupations is then 9.5%. When considering
“NUN” spells the proportion of all workers’ unemployment spells that cover total
net ﬂows is 4.1%, while the proportion of total gross ﬂows is 9.1%. Using the 1990
SOC and considering unemployment spells we ﬁnd that these proportions hardly
change: 4% and 9.9%, respectively. We ﬁnd that when considering industry mobility
these proportions are even smaller: 3.4% and 7%, respectively. Taken together this
evidence implies that about 95% of workers’ unemployment spells and about 90%
of all gross occupational ﬂows are driven by excess mobility.65
It is also evident that the importance of excess relative to net mobility occurs
across nearly all major occupations (industries). The main exception to this pat-
tern is “management”. This is clearest when using the 2000 SOC. Figures 53a and
53b show that the proportion of workers’ unemployment spells that originate from
“management” that cover the total net ﬂows of that occupation is around 40%. The
latter reﬂects two underlying forces. (i) A high outﬂow rate: around 62% of workers
who lose their jobs as managers change occupation after their unemployment (non-
employment) spell, where the majority of the “management” outﬂows end up in
“sales and related occupations” (22.1%), “ofﬁce and admin support” (19.9%), “busi-
65The overwhelming importance of excess relative to net mobility we document is consistent with
the results of Murphy and Topel (1987), Jovanovic and Mofﬁtt (1990) and Kambourov and Manovskii
(2008), who obtained large differences between excess and net mobility on pooled samples of em-
ployer movers and stayers.

ness and ﬁnancial operators” (13%) and “food preparation/serving” (12.7%). (ii) A
very small inﬂow rate: very few unemployed workers from other major occupa-
tions obtain jobs as managers at re-employment. We ﬁnd that less than 1% of all
unemployment spells end up in non-managers becoming managers. Excluding all
ﬂows involving “management” (7% of all workers’ unemployment spells) implies
that now 2.6% (instead of 4.2%) of all unemployment spells and 6.1% (instead of
9.5%) of all gross occupational ﬂows are needed to generate the observed net ﬂows
among the remainder occupations.66

Figure 33: Net and Gross Mobility per Occupation Task-based Categories
Figure 33 presents the same information as Figure 32, but when aggregating the
major occupational groups into task-based categories. The left panel includes “man-
agement”, while the right panel excludes it. Once again we ﬁnd an overwhelming
importance of excess mobility relative to net mobility. When including “manage-
ment” net mobility can be covered by 3.7% of all unemployment spells and 12.4%
of all gross ﬂows across the four task-based occupational groups. When excluding
workers with employment in “management” before or after unemployment, net
mobility can be covered by 2.1% of all remaining unemployment spells, which is
7.4% of all grows ﬂows in this set.
Even though net mobility is small, we ﬁnd clear patterns among the net ﬂows
across these task-based categories. In particular, Figure 33 shows that during the
66Using the 1990 SOC we obtain a lower net mobility rate because in this categorisation “manage-
ment” includes the 2000 SOC “management” and “business and ﬁnancial operators” occupations.
Also note that in the 1990 SOC both “transportation” and “helpers/laborers” are in purple, reﬂect-
ing that the average routine intensity score of “helpers/laborers” is also low (see Section A.1).
143
----------------------------------------

[Page 145 of 269]
1983-2013 period more workers left jobs in routine manual occupations than took
up jobs in these occupations. It also shows that more workers took up jobs in non-
routine manual occupations than left these occupations. There is also a clear pattern
in the net ﬂows of non-routine cognitive and routine cognitive occupations. Figure
33a shows that the non-routine cognitive occupations experienced net outﬂows. It
is immediate from comparing Figures 33a and 33b that the vast majority of the net
outﬂows from the non-routine cognitive occupations come from “management”. At
the same time, Figure 33a shows that the routine cognitive occupations experience
net inﬂows. As suggested by Figure 33b by far the main contributor to these net
inﬂows is “management”. We observe that by excluding the “management” ﬂows
the net inﬂow into the routine cognitive category basically disappears.
Taken together this evidence suggests that the net mobility that occurs through
unemployment or non-employment spells across task-based categories is best un-
derstood through the manual versus cognitive dimensions. Within the manual set
of occupations there is clear evidence of job polarization: routine jobs are disappear-
ing while non-routine jobs are on the rise. Within the cognitive set of occupations
job polarization is not so evident. Instead we observe that much of the net ﬂows
that arise between non-routine cognitive and routine cognitive occupations take the
form of managers losing their jobs and then re-gaining employment as sales or of-
ﬁce/administrative support workers. This type of mobility does not seem much re-
lated to structural change, but suggests a picture in which workers in higher skilled
jobs move down their career ladder to perform less skilled jobs after experiencing
job loss.
B.2.2 Mobility - duration proﬁle
We now turn to show that excess mobility is also the main driver of the mobility-
duration proﬁle. Figure 34a depicts the G-corrected mobility-duration proﬁle based
on the major occupational groups of the 2000 SOC (as in Figure 26a in Section A)
and subdivides the area below it into the contribution of net and excess mobility.
Recall that for a given unemployment duration x, the proﬁle shows the gross occu-
pational mobility rate as the fraction of workers who had at least xmonths in un-
employment and changed occupation at re-employment among those workers who

Figure 34: The importance of excess and net mobility
had at least xmonths in unemployment before regaining employment. To compute
the net and excess mobility rate for a given unemployment duration, we only use
those employment-unemployment-employment spells that had at least xmonths in
unemployment.
The area immediately below the proﬁle show the contribution of total net mo-
bility at each unemployment duration. This area is further subdivided into the con-
tribution that corresponds to the “management” ﬂows and to the contribution that
corresponds to the ﬂows of the remainder occupations. The area below net mobility
show the contribution of excess mobility at each unemployment duration. The hori-
zontal dashed line crossing this area shows the average excess occupational mobility
rate. The rest of the graphs in Figure 34 depicts the same information, but instead
145
----------------------------------------

[Page 147 of 269]
consider occupational mobility through non-employment spells with at least one
period of unemployment (’NUN’ spells), occupational mobility using the 1990 SOC
and industry mobility. It is immediate from these graphs that excess mobility is the
largest component of gross mobility at all unemployment (non-employment) du-
rations. Further, the importance of excess mobility increases with unemployment
(non-employment) duration. At the same time we observe that the importance of
net mobility also increases with unemployment (non-employment) duration, par-
ticularly the net mobility ﬂows that corresponds to the non-“management” occupa-
tions.
Figure 35a present the same information as above but now aggregating occupa-
tions using a task-based classiﬁcation. Figure 35b presents a very similar pattern
as in Figure 35a, but now aggregating non-routine cognitive and routine cognitive
into one category to subsume the “management” ﬂows into one (larger) cognitive
category. Once again we observe the importance of excess mobility in shaping the
mobility-duration proﬁle.

B.3 Cyclical patterns of occupational mobility
In Section 2 of the paper we document the cyclical patterns of occupational mobil-
ity for those workers who changed employers through intervening unemployment
(non-employment) spells. Here we investigate in more detail these cyclical patterns.
146
----------------------------------------

[Page 148 of 269]
Below we return to these patterns using the CPS and PSID.
B.3.1 Cyclical responsiveness of gross occupational mobility
Figure 36 displays the time series of the G-corrected and uncorrected occupational
(industry) mobility rates of unemployed workers, together with that of the aggre-
gate unemployment rate, in level deviations from their respective linear trends to
ﬁrst investigate the cyclical behaviour of the series with any formal ﬁltering method.
Figure 36a displays these patterns using the major occupational groups of the 2000
SOC, while Figure 36b displays these patterns using the 4 task-based categories:
Non-routine cognitive, routine cognitive, non-routine manual and routine manual.
The markers in the graphs depict the 5-quarter centered moving averages of the
time series, while the curves around these markers smooth the averages locally. The
key message from both graphs is that gross occupational mobility among unem-
ployed workers is procyclical . When comparing the linearly de-trended time series
of the centered 5-quarter moving average of the (log) occupation mobility rate with
that of the (log) unemployment rate, we ﬁnd correlations of -0.62 and -0.47 for the
2000 SOC and the 4 task-based categories classiﬁcation, respectively.67Figure 36c
shows that the procyclicality of occupational mobility among the unemployed is
also present when using the 1990 SOC. Differences in the cyclical patterns between
the 2000 SOC and 1990 SOC appear to be of second order. If anything, occupational
mobility seems somewhat more cyclically responsive when using the 1990 SOC. Fig-
ure 36d further shows the cyclical patterns of industry mobility. It shows that the
67Observations at the end of de-trended time series are estimated more imprecisely than those in
the middle. For this reason, bandpass ﬁltering typically excludes those observations. If we restrict
our attention to the time series window for which we would have bandpass de-trended observations,
1988q3 - 2010q1, the aforementioned correlations rise to (in absolute value) -0.82 for the case of the
2000 SOC and -0.80 for the 4 task-based categories. Restricting the sample to this window does not
change any of our conclusions. In particular, all empirical mobility elasticities from the linearly de-
trended series stay signiﬁcant at the 1%. For the HP ﬁltered series, conclusions also carry over, with
the restriction sharpening the pro-cyclicality of occupational mobility across the 4 task-based groups,
while blunting somewhat the cyclicality of industry mobility (see below). An exercise in which we
directly use each individual quarterly observation, which are much noisier (for example, there are
quarters in the data in which relatively few unemployed workers are hired), also yields broadly
similar results in these restricted window. While in this case correlations drop to around (-0.50,-
0.30) when linearly de-trended and around (-0.30,-0.10) when HP-ﬁltered, all linear de-trended series
discussed in this section stay statistically signiﬁcantly procyclical (with respect to unemployment) at
the 1%. Further, the elasticities of the HP-ﬁltered procyclical series of occupational mobility with
respect to HP-ﬁltered unemployment show procyclicality and still reach signiﬁcance at the 5% level
(1990 and 2000 SOC), and 10% (4 task-based categories), within the 1988q3-2010q1 window.
147
----------------------------------------

[Page 149 of 269]
gross industry mobility rate among the unemployed is also procyclical, exhibiting a
correlation of -0.56 between the linear de-trended industry mobility and unemploy-
ment rates.

shown evidence suggesting that the gaps in the SIPP series no do meaningfully af-
fect the degree of procyclicality. This is done using the CPS (see Section 5, below) as
an alternative data source and comparing the SIPP and CPS uncorrected series and
estimated elasticities with respect to unemployment. The ﬁrst four columns report
the results for the G-corrected mobility series and the last four columns for the un-
corrected series. The results in panel A conﬁrm the conclusion obtained from Figure
36: gross occupational mobility of the unemployed is procyclical. For all linearly de-
of elasticities, the HP-trend can only be obtained using interpolated time series. This likely intro-
duces some further noise for those quarters adjacent to interpolated quarters. On the other hand,
including interpolated quarters in the HP-ﬁltered time series allows some further information that
is contained in the linearly de-trended time series to weigh in the HP-ﬁltered series as well. Indeed,
including interpolated quarters in our calculation appears to strengthen the statistical signiﬁcance of
our coefﬁcients. To conservatively minimize the impact of interpolation, we focus on the statistics
excluding any interpolated quarters. In contrast, the linearly de-trended series are derived without
restoring to interpolation.
149

[Page 151 of 269]
trended series, the correlations are substantially negative and the elasticities are sta-
tistically signiﬁcantly negative at a 1% level. HP-ﬁltering leads to lower correlations
because unemployment and productivity are less aligned (see panel C of the table)
and the relative impact of noise is higher after HP-ﬁltering. Nevertheless, using the
HP-ﬁltered series yields elasticities with respect to the unemployment rate that are
signiﬁcant at the 5% level, with the exception of the 4 task-based categories. The
latter appears to be driven in part by the mobility patterns of those workers in man-
agerial occupations. As we highlighted before, management occupations behave
differently throughout the entire sample period, with consistently large relative net
outﬂow. Excluding those unemployment spells that are related to managerial occu-
pations results once again in a statistically signiﬁcant procyclical series when using
the 4 task-based categories.
Panel B shows that gross occupational mobility through unemployment is also
procyclical when using (log) productivity instead of (log) unemployment rate. For
the linearly de-trended series, the correlations are again high (around 0.70) and the
empirical elasticities are positive and signiﬁcant at a 1% level. Although the HP-
ﬁltered series are more noisy, they still yield statistically signiﬁcantly positive elas-
ticities at a 5% level for the 2000 SOC and 4 task-based categories series; and at a
1% level when considering the 4 task-based categories series without managerial
occupations. In the case of mobility across industries, we also ﬁnd positive and sta-
tistically signiﬁcant elasticities with respect to labor productivity. In terms of the
correlation coefﬁcients we ﬁnd that these are positive with respect to the linearly
de-trended productivity, but is nearly zero in the HP-ﬁltered series.69
Note that across panels A and B all elasticities are higher for the G-corrected
series than for the uncorrected series, illustrating that miscoding reduces the cyclical
response of gross occupational mobility.70
69One reason is that the HP-ﬁltered productivity series peaks around 2005, at which time industry
mobility of the unemployed is high compared to the average level, but at the same time somewhat
lower than in the earlier 2000s. The HP-ﬁltered series weighs the latter more heavily. Further, while
industry mobility subsequently meaningfully dropped in the Great Recession, it recovered at a rate
mirroring the recovery of unemployment. In contrast, HP-ﬁltered productivity dropped sharply at
the beginning of the Great Recession, but also recovered relatively sharply before the beginning of
2010. This behavior is partly behind the relatively low correlation between productivity and unem-
ployment as well. Interestingly, the correlations between mobility and unemployment, and between
mobility and output typically are at the same level, and at times even stronger, than the correlation
between output and unemployment for the main occupational mobility series.

Cyclical responsiveness using non-employment spells To complement the
above analysis, Table 31 considers the cyclical behavior of occupational mobility
among those workers who mixed periods of unemployment with periods of out-of-
labor-force during their non-employment spells (NUN-spells). In this case we also
ﬁnd that occupational and industry mobility are procyclical. Point estimates of the
elasticities of occupational mobility with respect to unemployment are somewhat
lower when using NUN spells rather than pure unemployment spells, but generally
these differences are not statistically signiﬁcant. Point estimates of the procyclical re-
sponsiveness of industrial mobility are instead higher. The linearly de-trended data
once again yield statistically signiﬁcant procyclicality at the 1% level across all mo-
bility measures. The HP-ﬁltered series also yields similar results when considering
mobility across major occupational groups (both 1990 and 2000 classiﬁcation) and
industry mobility. However, the pattern is statistically weaker for mobility across
the 4 task-based categories, but still marginally signiﬁcant (at the 10% level) in the
uncorrected data when managers are excluded.
ments), by isolating (using TRAMO/SEATS) the trend-cycle component, yields similar results. As a
consequence of the reduction in noise, standard errors are much smaller, and more of the elasticities
are signiﬁcant at the 1% level.

Cyclical responsiveness at different moments of the unemployment spell The
preceding analysis documents the procyclicality of occupational (industry) mobility,
measuring the state of the economy at the end of the unemployment spell; i.e. at the
time of job ﬁnding. Table 32 investigates whether this result survives when instead
we measure the unemployment rate at the beginning of the worker’s unemploy-
ment spell (at the time of job separation) or use the average of the unemployment
rates at job separation or job ﬁnding. The ﬁrst panel considers the case in which we
use the linearly de-trended (log) unemployment rate as our cyclical measure and
reports estimates of a regression incorporating a linear time trend and a dummy
variable for the change of occupational classiﬁcation at the 2004 panel. The main
message from the ﬁrst two rows is that measuring the unemployment rate at the
152
----------------------------------------

[Page 154 of 269]
moment of job separation or job ﬁnding does not affect our conclusions. In both
cases we ﬁnd that the occupational (industry) mobility of unemployed workers is
procyclical. Note that the point estimates obtained in the ﬁrst ﬁve columns decrease
when measuring the unemployment rate at the moment of job separation. How-
ever this decrease is not meaningful and the point estimates remain statistically sig-
niﬁcant. Taking the average of the unemployment rates at job separation and job
ﬁnding yields the highest empirical responsiveness in the point estimates, with sig-
niﬁcance at the 1% across all columns. Further, including both the unemployment
rate at job separation and at job ﬁnding, the point estimates reveal an additional
negative impact on mobility when unemployment rates are high both at the time of
job separation and job ﬁnding (and, in practice, in between), but this impact is not
statistically signiﬁcant.
In the second panel of Table 32 we relate occupational (industry) mobility to the
HP-ﬁltered (log) unemployment rate, measured again at the time of job separation
or of job ﬁnding. Here we also observe that occupational (industry) mobility re-
mains procyclical. However, we observe a meaningful drop in the responsiveness
of occupational mobility with respect to the unemployment rate when using the
2000 SOC and 1990 SOC and in the case of industry mobility. As in the previous
case, the clearest response is obtained when we use the average HP-ﬁltered unem-
ployment at the begin and end of the spell, with statistically signiﬁcant coefﬁcients
at the 1% level. When including both HP-ﬁltered unemployment rates, although
measured imprecisely, the impact of higher unemployment rate at the end of the
spell, ceteris paribus, is additionally negative (and not economically insigniﬁcant)
for mobility. For mobility across the 4 task-based categories, this impact is at least
marginally signiﬁcant at the 10% level, while for those NUN spells it is signiﬁcant
at the 5% level.
The above results then suggest that our benchmark analysis is conservative in
that we have not selected the timing of unemployment to maximize the cyclical
responsiveness of the occupational mobility rate among unemployed workers.
Cyclical responsiveness when controlling for demographic characteristics and
occupational identities Next we investigate whether the cyclical behavior of occu-
pational mobility among the unemployed is affected by demographic characteristics
153

[Page 155 of 269]
and/or the possible effects of source or destination occupations. Panels A and B of
Table 33 consider regressions of the form of the form
1occmob =b0+b1Cyclical Variable +Controls +#, (R1)
where as the cyclical variable we use either the linearly de-trended (log) unemploy-
ment rate and on the HP-ﬁltered (log) unemployment rate. Each panel is divided
into a number of sub-panels that present different set of controls. In the ﬁrst sub-
panel we consider a regression relating the uncorrected mobility to the relevant
cyclical variable, a linear time trend, and a dummy for 2000 SOC (implemented
in the 2004 and 2008 panels).71In the second sub-panel we add demographic con-
trols to the previous regression, while in the third sub-panel we further add source
occupation dummy variables. In the fourth sub-panel we further control for des-
tination occupation dummy variables instead of controlling for source occupation.
Column (i) considers the 2000 SOC, column (ii) the 1990 SOC, while column (iv)
considers simultaneous occupation and industry mobility and column (v) considers
industries based on the 1990 Census classiﬁcation. We analyse the 4 task-based cat-
egories including managerial occupations in column (vi) and excluding managerial
occupations in column (vii). In addition, in column (iii) we consider NUN spells in-
stead of just pure unemployment spells. Note that all of these regression extend the
corresponding regressions reported in Section 1 of this appendix by including the
relevant cyclical variable. Standard errors are derived by clustering at the quarter
level.
The main message from this table is that including demographic controls, or oc-
cupation (industry) ﬁxed effects do not seem to meaningful change the measured re-
sponsiveness of mobility with respect to the business cycle. Our evidence therefore
strongly suggests that the procyclicality of occupational/industry mobility among
the unemployed is not driven by compositional shifts, whereby in expansions (re-
cessions) we observe more (less) workers who are linked to occupation/industries
or demographic characteristics that are associated with higher mobility.
71We further have investigated the cyclical patterns during 1985-2003 period in isolation. This
analysis gives very similar results, although they produce less precise estimates.

Cyclical responsiveness when controlling for unemployment duration We
now investigate the role of unemployment (non-employment) duration in the cycli-
cality of gross occupational mobility. To do so, we estimate regressions of the form

rected data by further adding a time trend and controlling for classiﬁcation changes.

tively. Panel F considers the estimated duration coefﬁcient with added controls over

the same uncorrected data, but without a cyclical regressor. Note that because of
we use only those quarters with an uncensored duration distribution in the cycli-
cal analysis (and in panel F), these data is a subset of the one used to estimate the
overall duration proﬁle in the main text and the previous sections of this appendix.

Relative to the results in Table 33 (panel B), we observe that controlling for
the duration of the unemployment (non-employment) spell increases the cyclical
responsiveness of occupational mobility. This arises as the estimated unemploy-
ment coefﬁcient conditional on duration captures the vertical shift of the mobility-
duration proﬁle. Without controlling for duration, the unemployment coefﬁcient
captures both the vertical shift of the proﬁle and the rightward shift of the unem-
ployment duration distribution that one observes in recessions. The inclusion of
further controls does not meaningfully change either the slope of the proﬁle or the
156
----------------------------------------

[Page 158 of 269]
cyclical responsiveness of occupational mobility. This suggests that the scope to link
compositional shifts across source occupations (or demographics) to the observed
cyclicality of mobility conditional on completed unemployment duration is limited. Fur-
ther, it also runs counter to a role of occupational or demographical shifts in our
ﬁnding that recessions also exhibit a moderately increasing mobility-duration pro-
ﬁle for the unemployed .
B.3.2 Cyclical responsiveness of the mobility-duration proﬁle
We now turn to investigate the cyclicality of the mobility-duration proﬁle. Figures
37a, c and e depict the mobility-duration proﬁle in periods of high and low unem-
ployment, using the major occupations of the 2000 SOC and the 4 task-based cate-
gories. Periods of high unemployment are deﬁned as those in which the HP-ﬁltered
(log) unemployment rate lies within the top third of the distribution of HP-ﬁltered
(log) unemployment rates; while periods of low unemployment are deﬁned as those
in which the HP-ﬁltered (log) unemployment rate lies within the bottom third of the
distribution. The thickness of each proﬁle reﬂects the number of unemployed work-
ers with an unemployment spell of at least xmonths of duration. It is readily seen
that in periods of high unemployment there are both more unemployed workers
and longer unemployment spells. The main conclusion from these graphs is that
occupational mobility is higher in periods of low unemployment than in periods of
high unemployment at all unemployment durations . Figure 37a shows that when con-
sidering major occupations the two mobility-duration proﬁles are statistically differ-
ent from each other for those unemployment durations of up to 6 months. Beyond
this point, the mobility-duration proﬁle associated with periods of low unemploy-
ment becomes thinner and its conﬁdence bands become wider.72Figure 37e shows
that when considering the 4 task-based occupations without the managerial occupa-
tions, the two mobility-duration proﬁles are also statistically different from each at
shorter unemployment durations. Including the managerial occupations decreases
the precision of the estimates, generating wider conﬁdence intervals.
As a complementary way to investigate the shift of the mobility-duration pro-
ﬁle between periods of high and low unemployment, Figures 37b, d and f depict
72We do not plot the duration proﬁle when the associated conﬁdence interval becomes wider than
0.2.

high and low unemployment. This is in contrast to the mobility-duration proﬁles
considered in Figures 37a, c and e where, for example, a substantial part of those
in unemployment at 4 months will still be in unemployment at 5 months, and thus
contributing to the average occupational mobility at 4 and 5 months. Since the con-
struction of the marginal mobility-duration proﬁle relies on a much lower number
of observations at each duration, we make a functional form assumption on the shift
of this proﬁle over the cycle. Speciﬁcally, we estimate the probability that a worker
changed occupation (industry) at a given unemployment duration as

where 1Cyclis the cyclical indicator (0 for periods of high unemployment and 1 for
periods of low unemployment), and unemployment duration refers to completed
spell duration. We estimate this equation on the uncorrected (from miscoding) SIPP
data, controlling for a linear time trend and classiﬁcation changes. Note that equa-
tion R-X allows us to shift the marginal mobility-duration proﬁle differently at dif-
ferent durations following a quadratic relationship.73Figures 37b, d and f show that
in times of high unemployment, workers who end their unemployment spells at any
duration have a lower probability of changing occupation. The differences in prob-
ability of an occupational change is statistically signiﬁcant for durations between 2
and 10 months when using the 2000 SOC and between 2 and 7 months when using
the 4 task-based categories, excluding managerial occupations.
Figure 38 shows the marginal mobility-duration proﬁle by estimating regression
R-X using instead the linearly de-trended unemployment rate as the cyclical indica-
tor. In this case we observe an even stronger difference in the occupational mobility
rates of unemployed workers at any completed duration during periods of high
73We have also experimented with a cubic and quartic relationship. These alternatives at times
make the response stronger for durations between 6-10 months, while declining beyond 10 months.
However, beyond 10 months, the conﬁdence intervals in all cases become rather wide. Using an
alternative speciﬁcation, where instead of duration dummies for the proﬁle, we use a linear baseline
relation between mobility and duration does not change the presented relationship meaningfully.
Using a cubic or quartic formulation does not meaningfully change the direction of the shifts or its
statistical signiﬁcance, throughout this section.

and low unemployment rates. In particular, for the 4 task-based categories, includ-
ing managers, we now see that in periods of high unemployment the entire proﬁle
shifts down, and statistically signiﬁcantly so between 2 and 8 months.
Occupational Mobility and Rank in the Duration Distribution over the Busi-
ness Cycle To investigate to what extend the rightward shift in the mobility-duration
proﬁle observed in Figures 37a, c and e is due to a rightward shift in the unemploy-
ment duration distribution, we derive workers’ occupational mobility as a function
of the rank of their unemployment spell in the duration distribution. We do this
both in times of high and low unemployment, as deﬁned above. Figures 39a and
c, depict the relation between the average occupational mobility rate of the 100-x%
of longest unemployment spells with the rank of these unemployment spells in the
unemployment duration distribution. For both the major occupational groups of
the 2000 SOC and the 4 task-based categories we observe that at anygiven rank,
occupational mobility is lower in periods of high unemployment and this difference
appears statistically signiﬁcant for a wide interval of ranks around the median. This
implies that the downward shift of the mobility-duration proﬁle in times of high
unemployment goes beyond the rightward shift of the duration distribution associ-
ated with recessions. In particular, we do not observe that the business cycle shifts
mobility at lower quantiles of the duration distribution in a different direction than
it does at the higher quantiles. Therefore, it is not the case that relatively shorter

unemployment spells display more occupational attachment in a recession, while
simultaneously the relatively longer spells display less occupational attachment.
Figures 39b and d, investigate this issue further and depict the estimated change
in occupational mobility between period of high and low unemployment on indi-
vidual panel (uncorrected) data, controlling for a time-trend and classiﬁcation ef-
fects. We analyse occupational mobility ata given percentile of the (completed) du-
ration distribution, rather than the average occupational mobility of the subset of all
spells including and above that percentile, as in Figures 39a and c. Once again since
this exercise involves a lower number of observations we make a functional form
assumption on the relationship between unemployment duration and occupational

where 1Cyclis the cyclical indicator (0 for periods of high unemployment and 1 for
periods of low unemployment) and instead of unemployment duration dummies
we have a smooth quadratic duration proﬁle in recessions, and a (potentially) dif-
ferent quadratic duration proﬁle in booms.74
For mobility across major occupational groups we observe that at any given per-
centile of the completed unemployment duration distribution, mobility is higher in
periods of low unemployment relative to periods of high unemployment. This dif-
ference is statistically signiﬁcant for the vast majority of spells between the 35th and
90th percentile. This pattern is very similar for mobility across the 4 task-based cat-
egories, albeit statistically weaker. Thus recessions appear to reduce occupational
mobility across a wide range of the percentiles of the unemployment spell distri-
bution. Figure 40 shows the estimates for the same exercises as before, but using
the linearly de-trended unemployment rates as a cyclical indicator. Here we also
observe a cyclical shift in mobility across the whole distribution of unemployment
spells. In this case, the difference between periods of high and low unemployment
is statistically signiﬁcant at almost all quantiles of the distribution up to the 80-
90th percentile (2000 SOC) and between the 35th and 95th percentile (4 task-based
caterories).
Conclusion In recessions, unemployment spells are longer and unemployed
workers are less mobile. This pattern is shared across many subsets of the popula-
tion, when dividing by gender, education, age, occupations and industries. Within
a recession as within an expansion, longer-unemployed workers are relatively more
mobile. We show that the mobility-duration proﬁle appears to shift down in reces-
sions. However, the cyclical shift down of the duration proﬁle in recession goes
beyond a slowdown in the job ﬁnding rate. Throughout the quantiles of the unem-
74We also have experimented with linear, cubic and quartic speciﬁcations of the duration proﬁle,
which do not lead to different conclusions for the ﬁrst-order patterns discussed here, unless stated.

ployment spell distribution, occupational mobility goes down in recessions (statis-
tically so for a substantial part of the distribution). This pattern appears a general
feature of occupational and industrial mobility of the unemployed, and is likewise
present for the 1990 SOC and for 1990 Industry Census Classiﬁcation, in Figure 41.
B.3.3 The cyclical behaviour of net occupational mobility
To study the cyclical behavior of net mobility we split the sample of unemployment
spells into two groups. The ﬁrst group is composed by those spells that ended in
quarters with the highest (100 xb)% of HP ﬁltered (log) unemployment rates. We
label these quarters as “downturns”. The second group is composed by those un-
employment spells that ended in quarters with the lowest xg% of HP ﬁltered (log)
unemployment rates. We label these quarters as “expansions”. To proceed we need
to choose values for xgand xb. The choice of these percentile cutoffs, however,
presents the following trade-off. On the one hand, a low xg(and/or a high xb)
implies a relatively small sample of unemployment spells. This could be problem-
atic, as the law of large numbers is not necessarily strong enough in small samples
to mitigate randomness in the direction of observed occupational ﬂows.75On the
75Consider for example a set of gross ﬂows obtained from an underlying distribution of ﬂows
were net mobility is zero. If this set contains only one observation of occupational mobility, this
observation will be categories as a net ﬂow and one would need 100% of gross ﬂows to cover the net
ﬂow.

other hand, it could be the case that for structural reasons the response of net mo-
bility is larger when we restrict to more extreme cyclical periods. The latter will
imply that a low xg(and/or a high xb) by itself might go hand-in-hand with more
net mobility, because it concentrates on the most responsive periods.
To investigate whether this trade-off is important for the cyclicality of net mo-
bility, Figure 42 shows the net ﬂows across the 4 task-based categories as a function
ofxb,xg2[0.2, 0.8 ]. As described in the main paper these ﬂows are normalised by
the number of employment-unemployment-employment spells observed during ei-
ther expansion and recessions as deﬁned above. The blue curve depicts net ﬂows
in expansions and the black curve depicts net ﬂows in downturns. To compare net
mobility between expansions and recessions, deﬁned for example as periods with

Figure 44: Net Mobility Outﬂows (Inﬂows) per Occupations, and deﬁnition of High-
U and Low-U times
The main message that comes out of Figure 42 is that overall net mobility across
task-based categories is countercyclical for any xb,xg2[0.2, 0.8 ]. Thus, the varia-
tions in the size of our samples do not seem to affect our ﬁnding that net mobility
is countercyclical. Figure 43 presents the same exercise but focusing on individual
task-based categories. Figure 43a shows net mobility in expansions as a function
ofxg; while Figure 43b shows net mobility in downturns as a function of xb. Here
we observe that the net ﬂows of the routine manual and non-routine manual cat-
egories are larger in downturns than in expansions, implying that the net ﬂows of
these categories are countercyclical for any xb,xg2[0.2, 0.8 ]. Further, both in expan-
166

sions and downturns the non-routine manual category exhibits net inﬂows while the
routine manual category exhibits net outﬂows , consistent with the job polarization
literature. The patterns for the cognitive categories, however, are not as clear. For
example, we ﬁnd that the net ﬂows of the non-routine cognitive category are only
higher in downturns when considering xb,xg2[0.45, 0.8 ]. Figure 44 shows all these
net mobility ﬂows in more detail, depicting the pairwise expansion and downturn
comparison of net ﬂows for each category separately.
In light of the above, when analysing net mobility ﬂows we will take expansions
to represent quarters with below median HP ﬁltered (log) unemployment rates and
downturns to represent quarters with the 33% highest HP ﬁltered (log) unemploy-
ment rates. The beneﬁt of deﬁning the business cycle in this way is that the afore-
mentioned small sample issue seems to be less important in this deﬁnition of an ex-
pansion, where unemployment spells are less frequently observed. Indeed, the blue
curve in Figure 42a appears well behaved around the median.76Figure 42b also
shows that the standard NBER recessions and their immediate aftermath closely
correspond to this deﬁnition of downturns, while the second half of the 1990s, late
1980s, and mid-2000s till the beginning of the Great Recession closely correspond to
this deﬁnition of expansions.

76Also note the there is relatively little variation in the average net mobility between the 40th
and 65th percentile. As we restrict sample sizes when moving across these different cutoffs, noisier
observations of net ﬂows in the smaller set can drive up the average net mobility rate. This does not
seem to be the case for our measures.
167
----------------------------------------

[Page 169 of 269]
Analysing the business cycles in such a way implies that overall net mobility ac-
counts for 1.1% of workers unemployment spells in expansions, while it accounts
for 3.2% of workers unemployment spells in downturns. Figure 42 depicts these val-
ues as the intersection between the left-most vertical line with the blue curve and the
intersection between the right-most vertical line with the black curve, respectively.77
Figure 45a displays the net mobility patterns for each of the 4 task-based categories
also using this business cycle deﬁnition. As suggested by Figures 43 and 44, the
non-routine manual category exhibits a countercyclical increase in net inﬂows: in
downturns 3.2% of workers’ unemployment spells cover the net mobility of work-
ers into non-routine manual occupations, while only 1.1% of spells in expansions.
In contrast, the routine manual category exhibits a countercyclical increase in net
outﬂows: in downturns 1.7% of workers’ unemployment spells are needed to cover
the net mobility of workers out of routine manual occupations, while only 0.7% of
spells in expansions.
Figure 45b display the net mobility across the four task-based categories, but
now including managerial occupations in the non-routine cognitive category. In this
case net ﬂows of over 2% of all unemployment spells now originate from the non-
routine cognitive category, while the routine cognitive category now experiences
a net inﬂow as a result of former managers taking up administrative or sales jobs.
Further, the inﬂow from management mutes somewhat the outﬂow from the routine
manual category. Nevertheless, the same cyclical patterns regarding non-routine
and routine manual categories emerge. Net inﬂows into the former and net outﬂows
from the latter are larger in absolute value during downturns.
We now investigate whether the above net mobility patterns appear common
across the various expansion and downturn episodes we observe during our sample
period. Using the above deﬁnition of the business cycle, Figure 46a distinguishes
three expansion and three downturn episodes, where the quarters of our sample are
divided into largely connected (continuous) episodes.78To check the robustness of
77As an alternative to the above benchmark we also split the sample into two parts with an equal
number of observations. In this case expansions correspond to the lowest 61% of HP ﬁltered (log)
unemployment rates, and recessions correspond to the highest 39% of HP ﬁltered (log) unemploy-
ment rates. This alternative generates a similar cyclical change in net mobility, whereby net mobility
accounts for 1.0% of unemployment spells in expansions and accounts for 3.3% of unemployment
spells in recessions.
78We take those quarters with below-median unemployment rates in the second part of the 90s

our results, Figure 46b considers an alternative deﬁnition of the business cycle that
is closer to the NBER one. In this case we label as downturns the set of quarters
that starting with an NBER recession go until one year after peak unemployment
is reached. Expansions are the set of quarters preceding these downturns, going
backwards until a previous downturn is reached (with a two quarter gap) or until
the sample sizes are about balanced. This alternative deﬁnition differs from the
baseline one by including early NBER recession quarters in which HP-ﬁltered (log)
unemployment rates were low but rising fast, and by limiting the 1990s expansion
to the 1997-2000 period. Given that the overall number of net mobility ﬂows is small
(see Section 2 of this appendix), note that the main caveat of these exercises is that
each episode ends up containing an even smaller number of net ﬂows. As discussed
earlier this can generate nosier and potentially (upward) biased estimates.
The resulting net mobility patterns are displaying in Figures 47a and 47b. We
observe that the overall patterns described in Figure 45a seem to be common across
all expansions and downturns. In particular, we observe that across all episodes the
non-routine manual category exhibit net inﬂows, while the routine manual category
exhibits net outﬂows. The non-routine cognitive category also exhibits net outﬂows
in most episodes across the two business cycle deﬁnitions. The routine cognitive net
ﬂows, however, are close to zero but change direction across episodes. This means
that the overall low net mobility rate over the entire sample period does not mask
as one period, and exclude the 2008 quarters in the Great Recession that still have below-median
unemployment rates from the expansion.

meaningful reversals of direction or more substantial net mobility over time and
this seems to be consistent across different deﬁnitions of the business cycle.
We also observe that each expansion episode is associated with less net mobility
than in the downturn episodes. Moreover, across both business cycle deﬁnitions the
net inﬂows into the non-routine manual category are larger in downturns than in ex-
pansions. A difference, however, is that the net inﬂows during the Great Recession
170
----------------------------------------

[Page 172 of 269]
are more pronounced using the business cycle deﬁnition that is close to the NBER
one. This appears to reﬂect that in our data net mobility into the non-routine man-
ual category is noticeably higher during the NBER recession quarters of the Great
Recession, and less so in the aftermath. Since Figure 47b includes more of the afore-
mentioned NBER recession quarters, it naturally observe a stronger responds. Note
also the cyclical pattern in the net outﬂows from the routine manual category. These
net outﬂows appear typically larger in downturns than in expansions. This pattern
is strongest when using our baseline deﬁnition of the business cycle, but when us-
ing the deﬁnition closer to the NBER one we observe an increase in the net outﬂows
during the late 1990s expansion episode.
B.4 Job Finding Hazards and Spell Duration with Oc-
cupational Mobility
In this section we ﬁrst investigate the re-employment hazard functions of those
workers who changed employers through spells of non-employment, differentiat-
ing between these workers’ degrees of labor market attachments. This connects to
our calibration targets. We then analyse the differences in unemployment durations
between those workers who changed occupations and those who did not, and how
these durations respond over the cycle. This further connects to the model and cali-
bration, including the calibration outcomes. In particular, we document that in cycli-
cal downturns, it is the unemployment duration of movers that lengthens more. We
show that this result is robust even when controlling for destination and/or source
destinations.
B.4.1 Job Finding Hazard
The right-hand panel of Figure 48 shows the probability that a worker is still with-
out a job as a function of the number of months that have passed since losing his
previous job. The solid lines capture the survival functions for the set of workers
who have experienced unemployed for all months since losing their jobs, while
the dashed lines refer to male workers who have been unemployed for at least
one month since losing their job, but not necessarily all months, i.e. have a non-
171
----------------------------------------

[Page 173 of 269]
employment spell that mixes out of the labour force with unemployment (labelled
a “NUN-spell”). We restrict our attention to males here because females have in-
terestingly different patterns (with higher survival in non-employment at longer
duration), which nevertheless might be driven by different motives than the condi-
tions in their labour market alone. Males which have been unemployed for every
month since losing their job are not displayed separately, because the associated
graph stays very close to the depicted “U-spell” category for both males and fe-
males.
Within these categories, we can separately investigate the subset of young work-
ers (between 20-30 years old) and prime-aged (between 35-55 years old), drawn
in green (with diamond-shaped markers) and dark-blue (with circle markers) re-
spectively. We observe that survival in non-employment is indeed higher for those
workers who are not searching for a job in every month, but the general shape and
age differences seem preserved across both groups.

The left-hand panel of Figure 48 depicts the implied monthly job ﬁnding prob-
abilities, with Epanechnikov-kernel weighted local polynomial smoothing (band-
width 2.5). First note the extent of duration dependence in job ﬁnding in the ﬁrst
10 months, with a job ﬁnding rate that falls about 1 percentage point per month for
all unemployed workers. This “moderate” duration dependence is in part because
we focus on those workers who have become more strongly detached from employ-
ment. By construction, the workers we consider are without work for at least a

[Page 174 of 269]
whole month (hence, the job ﬁnding rate in the ﬁrst month refers to the probability
of ﬁnding a job within the next month, after having been unemployed for a month).
We also exclude workers in temporary layoff, who have a higher job ﬁnding rate.
As a result of these restrictions, our hazard functions do not exhibit the steep
drop typically observed during the ﬁrst month in unemployment (which can be
seen e.g. in Farber and Valletta, 2015, Figure 3, based on the CPS). As argued in
the main text, our restrictions are motivated by the ﬁnding in the literature that
entrants into unemployment can be separated roughly into two different groups:
a set of workers who has high job ﬁnding rates and behaves differently over the
cycle, with most of the cyclical movement in the unemployment rate due to those
who are in the second, slower job-ﬁnding group. We want to focus on the latter
group. Fujita and Moscarini (2017) highlight the roll of recalls for the ﬁrst group and,
importantly also for our paper, highlight the different job ﬁnding expectations of the
ﬁrst group. This motivates our exclusion from unemployment/non-employment of
those who are classiﬁed in the SIPP as “with a ﬁrm, on layoff”. Ahn and Hamilton
(2019) similarly argue that two different sets of workers enter unemployment, with
cyclical movements largely driven by the group which exhibits in comparison less
propensity to return to employment.

Figure 49: Aggregate Job Hazard - unconstrained unemployment deﬁnition
Figure 49 depicts the hazard function of those workers who reported conventional
unemployment the month before the interview (to ‘mimic’ the CPS), after dropping
the aforementioned restrictions on entering unemployment and non-employment.
In this case we indeed observe a much stronger duration dependence, where there is
a large drop in the hazard function during the ﬁrst month (see Fujita and Moscarini,
173
----------------------------------------

[Page 175 of 269]
2017, for a similar result also using the SIPP). Thus, the negative duration depen-
dence among the unemployed (non-employed) we consider in this paper is indeed
relatively weaker than when considering the full set of conventionally-unemployed
workers in the same data. Aside from this, the seam effect on the job ﬁnding rate is an
additional issue that is clearly visible in Figure 49, at four month intervals. Although
with our restrictions the seam effect is weaker in Figure 48, we will attempt to mini-
mize its impact in the calibration by using survival rates at four month intervals (in
addition to the ﬁrst-month job ﬁnding rate).
Note that the extent of negative duration dependence exhibited by each group-
speciﬁc hazard function depicted in Figure 48b is not too dissimilar from each other.
Workers in the ‘U’ group exhibit the higher absolute change in the job ﬁnding rate
with duration and workers in the ‘NUN’ group exhibit the lower absolute change,
but with similar relative changes of the job ﬁnding rate with duration. The main dif-
ference between these hazard functions seem to be more in levels, where workers
in the ‘U’ group exhibit the highest hazard rates and workers in the ‘NUN’ groups
exhibit the lowest hazard rates across all durations. The relative reduction in job
ﬁnding of prime-aged workers in “pure” unemployment spells (when compared
to younger workers) seems to be similarly present in the “mixed” spells of non-
employment with some unemployment. Interesting, although not further empha-
sized in our paper is the non-monotonicity in the job ﬁnding rate with duration of
the young around 12 months, which is suggestive of a sensitivity to beneﬁt exhaus-
tion that is particularly strong for this group. We abstract from this feature in the
paper, but it is worth noting that our calibration targets, which consider survival
probabilities in four months intervals, smooth this non-monotonicity out.
B.4.2 Job ﬁnding differences among occupational movers and stay-
ers
B.4.2.1 Long-run patterns
The positive slope of the mobility-duration proﬁle implies that occupational movers
take longer to ﬁnd jobs than occupational stayers. We now investigate whether this
difference is still present after controlling for demographic characteristics and occu-

pational identities. To do this we report several estimates of the difference between
the unemployment durations of occupational stayers and movers based on the un-
corrected data. These estimates are obtained from regressions of the form
Duration of U =b0+boccmob 1occmob +bdmdemog.ctrls +boccocc.dum +#, (R4)
where “Duration of U spell” is the individual’s completed unemployment spell, 1occmob
is a binary indicator that takes the value of one (zero) if a worker changed (did not
change) occupation at the end of his/her unemployment (non-employment) spell,
the demographic controls include dummies for gender, education, marital status,
race and age, “occ.dum” denotes occupation identity dummies and #is the error
term. Table 35 present the results of these regressions by progressively adding de-
mographic and occupation identity controls. Columns (2) and (3) use the sample
of completed durations among all unemployed workers, while Columns (4)-(8) re-
stricts the sample to the completed durations of young and prime-aged unemployed
workers.
Column (2) shows the results from estimating (R4) without any controls other
than the occupational mobility dummy. It shows that occupational movers take on
average an additional 0.5 months to ﬁnd a job. This difference arises as the average
unemployment duration of occupational stayers is 3.6 months, while the average
unemployment duration of occupational movers is 4.1 months. This difference is
also economically signiﬁcant: it represents nearly half of the differences between the
average unemployment spell duration in times of low unemployment (expansions)
and times of high unemployment (recessions).79
The rest of the columns show that the estimated difference between the average
unemployment durations of occupational movers and stayers does not seem to be
driven by composition effects. Column (3) reports the results from estimating (R4)
when adding worker demographic characteristics. It shows that the estimated coef-
ﬁcient of the occupational mobility dummy hardly changes. Column (4) shows that
the estimated coefﬁcient of the occupational mobility dummy also hardly changes
79We consider times of high (low) unemployment as those quarters in which the HP de-trended
(log) unemployment rate lies within the 33% highest (lowest) HP de-trended unemployment rates.
The average unemployment length in those quarters with high unemployment is 4.4 months,
whereas the average unemployment spell lasts 3.3 months in the quarters with the low unemploy-
ment.

when restricting the sample to young and prime-aged workers and adding demo-
graphic characteristics. In columns (5)-(7) we further add source and destination
occupational identity dummies. Here we observe a drop of up to 5 percentage
points in the difference between average unemployment durations of occupational
movers and stayer. However, note that a difference of 0.45 months still remains
economically signiﬁcant. This suggests that the difference in the average duration
of the unemployment spell between occupation movers and stayers is not a result
of workers moving out of (or into) occupations in which typically all workers take
longer to ﬁnd jobs. The increased unemployment duration of occupational movers
thus seems to be associated with the act of moving itself. Therefore this evidence
does not seem to support theories that are based on workers moving into a partic-
ular subset of occupations in which newcomers need to spend relatively more time
to ﬁnd jobs because of, for example, re-training.
Table 35, however, does show important differences across age groups. Column
(8) reports that prime-aged workers take 0.33 months longer to ﬁnd a job when
they changed occupations than young occupational movers. In this case the role
of other demographic characteristics factors appears more limited, once we con-
trol for age and occupational identities. The bottom panel of Table 35 present sev-
176
----------------------------------------

[Page 178 of 269]
eral F-tests evaluating the equality of the occupational mobility dummies speciﬁc
to demographic characteristics and occupational identities. These F-test highlight
two important results. There is a statistically signiﬁcant interaction between age
and the additional unemployment duration of occupational movers. There is not a
statistically signiﬁcant interaction between the rest of the demographic or occupa-
tional identity dummies and the additional unemployment duration of occupational
movers.
B.4.2.2 Business cycle patterns
Table 36 extends the previous analysis and considers the cyclicality of the differ-
ence between the completed unemployment durations of occupational movers and
stayers. In Section 3.2 we documented that the mobility-duration proﬁle is procycli-
cal: at any duration the occupational mobility rate is higher in expansions than in
recessions. We now show that ties in with a countercyclical distance between the
unemployment durations of movers versus stayers. In particular, we estimate
Duration of U =b0+boccmob 1occmob +bocc.un 1occmoburate +bdmdemog.ctrls +boccocc.dum +#,
(R5)
where the new explanatory variable is relative to equation (R4) is the interaction
between occupational mobility and the unemployment rate. The latter appears as
“diff resp. (responsiveness between) movers vs stayers” in Table 36.
Panel A of Table 36 considers as the measure of the business cycle the log of
the aggregate unemployment rate, controlling for a linear time trend. The results
presented in the ﬁrst set of four columns use as the dependent variable spells in
which the worker was classiﬁed unemployed since loosing his/her job until ﬁnding
a new one (U-spells). The second set of four columns use as the dependent variable
spells in which the worker was classiﬁed at least one month as unemployed and
the rest as out of the labour force since loosing his/her job until ﬁnding a new one
(NUN-spells). In each case, the ﬁrst three columns consider all workers, while the
last column restricts the sample to young and prime-aged workers.
For both types of non-employment spells, we observe that when the aggregate
unemployment rate increases the differences between the completed spell duration
of occupational movers and stayers increases. That is, during recession (times when

unemployment is high) occupational movers experience even stronger increases
in unemployment duration than occupational stayers do. As shown across the
columns, this result also holds (with rather stable coefﬁcients for U-spells) when
controlling for demographic characteristics (including a quadratic in age) and dum-
mies for the occupation of origin and destination.80Our results also show that the
responsiveness of the difference in unemployment durations to the unemployment
rate is stronger when considering NUN-spells.
80Kroft et al. (2016) ﬁnd that compositional shifts matter little for the increase in long-term un-
employment in recessions; our results are related in the sense that we ﬁnd that compositional shifts
matter little for the increase in the duration difference between occupational movers and stayers in
recessions. This increase is proportionally stronger than the drop in occupational mobility of the un-
employed that is broadly shared across occupations. Hence the lengthening of spells of occupational
movers contributes to the lengthening of unemployment and, in particular, long-term unemploy-
ment across occupations in recessions.

[Page 180 of 269]
Panel B of Table 36 instead considers as the measure of the business cycle the
cyclical component of the log of aggregate unemployment rate, where the cyclical
component is obtained through an HP ﬁlter. It is immediate from the table that the
conclusions obtained from using this measure are the same as the ones obtained
when using the linearly de-trended logged unemployment rate.
B.4.2.3 Summary
In Section 1 we have documented that at any unemployment duration, occupational
movers largely move across all occupations. Here we have shown that conditional
on a given occupation, an occupational mover takes longer to ﬁnd a job than an oc-
cupational stayer and that this difference increases in recessions. It is important to
highlight that this does not mean that different occupations exhibit the same aver-
age unemployment duration. Indeed, we do ﬁnd differences in the estimated coefﬁ-
cients of the source and destination occupation dummies (see Section 1.5), suggest-
ing that some occupations do lead all workers (occupational movers and stayers) to
ﬁnd jobs fasters than workers in other occupations (in line with Wiczer, 2015). What
our results suggest is that even though a worker might have experienced job loss
in an occupation that exhibits short or long overall unemployment durations, this
worker will take on average longer to ﬁnd a job if he/she is to change occupations
at re-employment and even longer if he/she changes in a recession.
B.5 Occupational mobility in the PSID and the CPS
We now turn to investigate some of our main ﬁndings using alternative data sources:
the Current Population Survey (CPS) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics
(PSID). Analysing occupational mobility through the CPS is helpful even though
these data is not corrected for measurement error. In particular, the CPS has the
advantage of providing the longest, uninterrupted series of occupational mobility,
even spanning into 2021. This allows us to evaluate whether the breaks in the SIPP
time series have a meaningful effect on the extent and cyclicality of gross occupa-
tional mobility. For this purpose and because the individual-worker panel dimen-
sion of the CPS is much shorter relative to the SIPP , we only use these data to investi-
179
----------------------------------------

[Page 181 of 269]
gate the average gross mobility rate. In Section 2 of the main paper we conclude that
the CPS and the (uncorrected) SIPP gross mobility series have very similar degrees
of procyclicality. Another advantage of using the CPS is that it is easily accessible.
We use the CPS data available via IPUMS.81
The PSID is also useful for several reasons: (i) It provides a longer panel di-
mension than the SIPP . (ii) We can compare our main results with the analysis of
Kambourov and Manovskii (2008), who use this data set to provide a highly inﬂu-
ential analysis of the occupational mobility patterns found in the US labor market.
Therefore, in constructing our sample we closely follow Kambourov and Manovskii
(2008, 2009). The details of this sample are described in the “Data Construction” sec-
tion of this appendix. (iii) It allows us to evaluate the extend of coding error using
retrospective coding as an alternative method. In particular, we use the PSID retro-
spective occupation-industry supplementary data ﬁles, which contain the re-coding
the PSID staff performed on the occupational mobility records obtained during the
1968-1980 period. Since the 1981-1997 records were not re-coded and collected un-
der independent interviewing, the earlier period can be used to construct “clean”
occupational mobility rates and to analyse the effect of measurement error at the
coding stage.
B.5.1 Occupational mobility in the CPS
B.5.1.1 Extent of occupational mobility
To derive the average gross occupational mobility rate among the unemployed in
the CPS we compare the occupation coded immediately before the worker became
unemployed with the occupational code at re-employment. From this set of work-
ers, the gross mobility rate is then computed as the proportion of occupational
movers among all those who went through unemployment and subsequently found
a job. We focus on the 22 major occupational groups of the 2010 SOC, which are
provided homogenized for the entire 1976-2021 period by IPUMS. Using the full ex-
tent of our sample, we obtain an average occupational mobility rate of 47.5%. One
concern could be that since in 1994 the CPS underwent a signiﬁcant re-design, the
81Our STATA do-ﬁle is available upon request, while the underlying data can be download from
IPUMS, at https://cps.ipums.org/cps/
180
----------------------------------------

[Page 182 of 269]
occupational mobility rate should be affected. However, computing this rate for the
period 1994-2021 yields 46.6%, hardly changing the extent of mobility.
A perhaps more important concern is that in this sample we are including work-
ers in temporary layoffs, who are very likely to return to their previous occupations
and employers (see Fujita and Moscarini, 2017). This would bias downward the
occupational mobility rate. To leave out temporary layoffs, we drop those unem-
ployed classiﬁed as “job loser/on layoff” in the reported reasons for unemploy-
ment. This category corresponds to individuals who are on temporary layoff , with
the expectation to be recalled with a speciﬁc date or within 6 months. Note that in
this case we only use data from 1994 onwards as after the 1994 redesign we have
available a homogenous series for “reasons for unemployment”, without discrete
jumps associated with shifting deﬁnitions/survey questions. Once we drop these
temporary layoff workers, the average occupational mobility rate indeed increases
to 56.9%. This value is very similar to the 55.0% we obtained from the uncorrected
SIPP when using the 21 major occupational groups of the 2000 SOC and dropping
the temporary layoffs (See Table 25 in Section 1 of this Appendix).
B.5.1.2 Cyclicality of occupational mobility
Figure 50a plots the time series of the average gross occupational mobility rate of
workers hired from unemployment. To smooth out some of the noise in the quar-
terly observations, we present a lowess smoothed version in such a way that busi-
ness cycle patterns remain visible. We also depict this series HP trend (ﬁltered with
parameter 1600). The redesign of the CPS in the mid-1990s means that the pre-1994
series might not be fully comparable to the post-1994 series. Following a conser-
vative approach, we have HP ﬁltered the entire 1976-2021 series but then removed
observations for the period 1992-1995 to stay clear of the 1994 design break. To cap-
ture business cycle conditions, Figure 50a depicts the unemployment rate (and its
HP trend with parameter 1600).
A comparison of these series reveals a procyclical pattern in occupational mo-
bility. When the occupational mobility rate is above its trend, unemployment is
typically below its trend. This is clearly visible around the last three recessions (in-
cluding the Covid recession), but also in the double-dip recession in early 1980s.

Figure 50b shows a similar conclusion using the HP-ﬁltered unemployment and
occupational mobility rates for the full sample. A reasonable concern is that the ob-
served occupational mobility in the previous graphs is affected by an increased im-
portance of temporary layoffs in recessions. Figure 50c considers the series without
temporary layoffs and once again shows a procyclical occupational mobility rate.
To further investigates the robustness of our ﬁndings, in Figures 51a and 51b we
only consider the time series from 1994 up to the fourth quarter of 2019. In this
way we focus on the period after the 1994 re-design and drop the large decrease in
occupational mobility observed during the Covid recession. While this somewhat
changes the de-trended behavior in the last ﬁve years of the series, it does not seem
to meaningfully affect its procyclicality. In Figures 51c and 51d we re-do this exer-
cise but now using bandpass ﬁltering instead of the HP-ﬁlter to better deal with the

procyclicality in the occupational mobility series, with clearly visible drops in occu-
pational mobility during and in the aftermath of the 2001 and 2008 recessions.
Finally, Table 37 investigates the cyclicality of HP and bandpass ﬁltered obser-
vations without additional smoothing. In particular, we regress the quarterly ob-
servations of the de-trended log gross occupational mobility rate on a constant and the
de-trended log unemployment rate. We report the coefﬁcient and standard error
associated with the latter. We observe that, after taking out the HP-trend (with pa-
rameter 1600), occupational mobility decreases in times of higher unemployment.
This relationship is statistically signiﬁcant when using all the sample period or after
the 1994 CPS re-design (with and without temporary layoffs). Using the bandpass

B.5.2 Occupational mobility in the PSID
B.5.2.1 Extent and cyclicality
Using these data, Supplementary Appendix A.3 documents that when condition-
ing the sample only on those who changed employers through non-employment
(ENE ), the gross occupational mobility rates are high across different levels of ag-
gregation. In particular, the raw data shows that the average occupational mobil-
ity rates among the non-employed are 39.6%, 44.7% and 56.2% at a one-, two- and
three-digit levels, respectively, for the period 1970-1980. The average occupational
mobility rates for these workers for the period 1981-1997 are 41.1%, 47.4% and 60.1%
at a one-, two- and three-digit levels, respectively.
To compare these mobility rates with the occupational mobility rate among all
workers (employer movers and stayers pooled together), we divide the numerator
of the ENE rate by the total number of employed workers at year t(the denominator
of our overall rate). In this case we ﬁnd that the occupational mobility rates through
non-employment are 2.5%, 2.8% and 3.5% for the period 1970-1980 and 3.2%, 3.7%
and 4.7% for the period 1981-1997, at a one-, two- and three-digit levels, respec-
tively. These rates are consistent with the results of Kambourov and Manovskii
184
----------------------------------------

[Page 186 of 269]
(2008), who show that unemployed workers contribute 2.5% to the year-to-year oc-
cupational mobility rate of a pooled sample of employer movers and stayers based
on a two-digit level. It is important to note, however, that the information presented
in Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) does not allow us to infer that their 2.5% esti-
mate is consistent with mobility rates among the non-employed of over 40%. To
arrive to this conclusion one has to re-do Kambourov and Manovskii’s (2008) anal-
ysis as done here.
Table 6 in Supplementary Appendix A.3 shows the marginal effects obtained
from probit regressions to further investigate the cyclicality of gross occupational
mobility.82In these regressions the dependent variable takes the value of one if the
worker changed occupation and zero otherwise. We control for age, education, full
or part-time work, occupation of origin, region of residence, aggregate and regional
unemployment rates, a quadratic time trend, number of children and the impact
of retrospective coding.83Our results show that gross occupational mobility of the
non-employed is also procyclical.
These results corroborate the ones obtained using the SIPP . Hence, we ﬁnd that
across data sets the probability of an occupational transition among the unemployed
(or non-employed) is high and increases in expansions and decreases in recessions.
The procyclicality of gross occupational mobility among the unemployed comple-
ments the result found by Kambourov and Manovskii (2008), who show that the
year-to-year occupational mobility rate of a pooled sample of employer movers and
stayers is procyclical. In principle there is no reason to expect that the procyclical
pattern these authors ﬁnd in the overall occupational mobility rate would translate
to the occupational mobility rate for the unemployed. Indeed, as discussed above,
the latter contributes a small proportion to the overall rate.
82These estimates are obtained using the personal weights provided by each survey, but similar
results are obtained when using the unweighted data. We also obtained very similar results when
using the linear probability model on weighted and unweighted data and when using robust stan-
dard errors and clustering standard errors at a yearly level.
83As in Kambourov and Manovskii (2008), the education indicator variable takes the value of one
when the worker has more than 12 years of education and zero otherwise. This is to avoid small
sample problems if we were to divide educational attainment in more categories. The regional un-
employment rates are computed using US states unemployment rates.

----------------------------------------

[Page 187 of 269]
B.5.2.2 Repeat mobility
In the SIPP analysis we found that a large proportion of workers who experienced
an occupational change in their previous non-employment spell also experienced
an occupational change at the end of their current non-employment spell. Similarly,
we found that a large proportion of workers who did not change occupation in their
previous non-employment spell experienced an occupational change at the end of
their current non-employment spell.
A potential concern with the SIPP structure is that it does not follow workers for
a long enough period. While in the calibrated model, we deal with this by imposing
an analog restriction on the time window of measurement, such that the data and
model statistics capture exactly the same type of repeat mobility, one would still
want to extrapolate repeat mobility patterns to apply more generally (to longer pe-
riods of workers’ labour market history). This extrapolation might generate a bias
in the repeat occupational mobility statistics as the statistics in the SIPP will dispro-
portionally capture: (i) those workers with shorter non-employment spells, even
though we leave enough time towards the end of the SIPP panel to try to capture
longer non-employment spells; and (ii) those workers with short employment du-
rations between consecutive non-employment spells. To analyse the extent of this
bias we re-compute the repeat mobility statistics using the PSID based on the sam-
ple used to construct the ENE occupational mobility rate depicted in Figure 3.b in
Supplementary Appendix A.3. Since these data sets allow us to follow the same
workers for a longer period of time, we expect (i) and (ii) to have a much smaller
impact.
Table 38 shows the repeat mobility statistics at a one-, two- and three-digit level
of aggregation, using the 1970 SOC. The proportions are based on weighted data,
but similar proportions are obtained using unweighted data. For each level of ag-
gregation we divide the sample by whether a worker was an occupational stayer or
an occupational mover after the ﬁrst non-employment spell. We then compute the
proportion of stayers (movers) who, after a subsequent non-employment spell, did
not change occupation and the proportion who changed occupation. For each level
of aggregation, the ﬁrst two rows show the proportions for stayer- stayer and stayer-
mover. These proportions add up to one. Similarly, the second two rows show the

proportions for mover-stayer and mover-mover. Further, the columns labelled “Occ.
Mobility” consider workers who only changed occupations. Since these statistics are
based on raw (uncorrected) data, the propensity to change occupations would be bi-
ased upward. As a way to deal with the latter, we consider simultaneous occupation
and industry mobility and re-compute the repeat mobility statistics. These are pre-
sented in the columns labelled “Occ. + Ind. Mobility”. As discussed in Section 1
of this appendix, conditioning on simultaneous occupation and industry mobility
provides an alternative way to correct for coding errors. In particular, we consider
a worker to be an occupational mover if and only if he/she reported a change in
occupation and a simultaneous change in industry at the same level of aggregation,
where industry changes are based on the 1970 census industries codes.84
The PSID shows a very similar picture to the one obtained from the SIPP . There
is a high proportion of workers who changed occupation after a non-employment
spell and once again changed occupations after a subsequent non-employment spell.
84These repeat mobility statistics are calculated based on up to ﬁve consecutive non-employment
cycles, where a cycle is constructed as non-employment, employment, non-employment, employ-
ment sequence. The number of observations in our repeat mobility sample is then the product of
the number of cycles per individual. The majority of workers, however, experience only one cycle,
which make up for 80% of the total number of observations. We ﬁnd that our results do not change
if we were to compute these same statistics based only on workers’ ﬁrst cycle.
187
----------------------------------------

[Page 189 of 269]
Out of all those workers who were occupational movers after a non-employment
spell in the raw data, between 53% (at a one-digit level) and 74% (at a three-digit
level) moved occupations once again after a subsequent non-employment spell.
There is also an important proportion of workers who did not change occupation
after a non-employment spell, but did change occupations after a subsequent non-
employment spell. Out of all those workers who were stayers after a non-employment
spell, between 33% (at a one-digit level) to 48% (at a three-digit level) moved occu-
pations after the subsequent non-employment spell.
Conditioning simultaneous occupation and industry changes does not drasti-
cally change these results. In this case, out of all those workers who were occu-
pational movers after a non-employment spell, between 41% (at a one-digit level)
and 67% (at a three-digit level) moved occupations once again after a subsequent
non-employment spell. Out of all those workers who were stayers after a non-
employment spell, between 23% (at a one-digit level) to 33% (at a three-digit level)
moved occupations after the subsequent non-employment spell. That is, condition-
ing on simultaneous occupation and industry changes, decreases by about 10 per-
centage points the occupational mobility rates, but still shows a high propensity for
repeat mobility among the non-employed.
B.6 Self-reported retrospective occupational mobility
In this section we propose an alternative way to analyse the occupational mobil-
ity patterns of the non-employed that is not subject to coding errors. In particular,
we use information on workers’ self-reported employer and occupational tenure
obtained from the SIPP core panels and topical modules. For the majority of SIPP
panels the ﬁrst topical module asks “for how many [months/years] has [the worker]
done the kind of work [he] does in this [current] job”, or a variation of it.85In addi-
tion, it records the start date with the current employer andthe start and end dates
of the most recently ﬁnished employer spell previous to the panel.86
85This question is asked in topical module in the 1984, 1987, 1990, 1991, 1992 and 1993 panels. In the
1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008, the question is in the core waves and makes explicit reference to the entire
working life, while invoking ‘occupation’/‘line of work’ rather than ‘kind of work’: “Considering
entire working life, how many years has [the worker] been in this occupation or line of work?”.
86The question referring to the current employer is “when did [the worker] start working for [ex-
plicit employer name]”. The wording means that employer recalls are not (or, at least, should not
188
----------------------------------------

[Page 190 of 269]
Using this information we restrict attention to those workers whose completed
non-employment spells lasted between one and twelve months. This restriction
helps us capture a group of workers who have not lost their attachment to the labour
market even though they might be categorised as non-participants at some point
during the spell87Below, we also focus on subsets of this group that e.g. are ob-
served with periods of unemployment. To determine whether or not one of these
workers changed occupations, we compare the employer tenure with the occupa-
tional tenure information. In particular, out of all those workers who found their
current job out of non-employment, we label a worker as an occupational mover
when his/her occupational tenure equals (or is very close to) his/her employer
tenure and as an occupational stayer when his/her occupational tenure is (sufﬁ-
ciently) greater than his/her employer tenure.88We then compute the occupational
mobility rate by dividing the number of non-employed workers who re-gained em-
ployment and changed occupation over the number of non-employed workers who
re-gained employment.
B.6.1 The extent of self-reported occupational mobility
Table 39 shows the extent of occupational mobility of the non-employed using four
different samples. The ﬁrst column (overall) considers all employed workers who (i)
went through a spell of non-employment before starting with the current employer,
provided that the non-employment spell occurred during the last ten years; (ii) have
spent more than two years in the labor force, (iii) have ﬁnished their previous job
at least one year after entering the labor market and (iv) have held their previous
be) recorded as starts of employment. In the 1996-2008 panels, the question also refer to “... the
month/year when [worker’s name] began employment with [employer name]”.
87For most of the panels we obtain the duration of the non-employment spell by subtracting the
date in which the job with the previous employer ended from the day the re-employment job started
with the current employer. In the 1984 panel the duration of the non-employment spell is asked
directly. In the 2004 and 2008 panels we can only observe a lower bound of the non-employment
spell as we only have information on the year the job with the previous employer ended. For this
reason some of our analysis (see below) will not use the 2004 and 2008 panels. Note that the mobility
reported in the 1984 panel lies
88When occupational tenure does not exactly match the employer tenure due to, potentially, recall
errors, we consider several plausible adjustments to identify occupational movers and stayers. We
discuss these in the next section.
189

[Page 191 of 269]
job for at least twelve months.89These restrictions are made to focus on those who
have had meaningful employment before any spell of non-employment, so we are
considering changes of occupation, rather than a start within an occupation at the
beginning of working life. These restrictions also help with inferring occupational
mobility from occupational tenure.
The second column (attached workers) restricts the “overall” sample to those
spells in which the worker entered non-employment because they were laid off, dis-
charged, a temporary job ended, indicated dissatisfaction with the previous job, or
because of a non-family/non-personal (“other”) reason.90We consider these work-
ers to be attached to the labor market as they did not leave their jobs for reasons
that indicate leaving the labor force.91Given that the above restrictions could not be
applied across all panels, these two samples only rely on the topical modules of the
1984, 1987-88 and 1990-1993 SIPP panels.
The third column (recent hires) considers those workers whose re-employment
job started within six months prior to the time of interview and had a job tenure
of at least 12 months before transiting into non-employment. The last restriction
enable us to more conﬁdently distinguish the current employer’s tenure from the
sum of the current and previous employer’s tenure, which reduces ambiguous cases
when inferring occupational mobility from self-reported occupational tenure. The
cost, obviously, is a smaller sample of workers, as logically we can include only
workers with a low job tenure at the moment that the retrospective occupational

89We have excluded workers who have imputed start and dates of the previous job in the data, or
an imputed start date of the current job. In case ambiguity remains about occupational changing, we
have excluded these workers as well. If we take a strict approach to assignment of mobility within
this subset of workers, mobility is closer to 50% than in the unambiguous group. Hence, we consider
the exclusion of ambiguous observations to yield conservative levels of self-reported occupational
mobility.
90Including “Other” (but excl.: “other, family reasons”) does not change our conclusions.
91For the “overall” and “attached” samples, we only count an occupational move at the end of the
non-employment spell when the current job started within six months of the start of the occupation
and the previous job lasted for at least one year. For a worker to be considered an occupational
mover in these samples, the current job starting date must be within a six months interval around
the implied start of the occupation and the previous job must have lasted at least a year. Further,
given that occupational tenures above twelve months are reported in full years it was difﬁcult to
assess an occupational change when a relatively long tenure in the current job is preceded by a short
tenure in the previous job. We take a conservative approach and categorise the latter cases as a
employer move without an occupational change.

non-employment spells. The fourth column (“Hires after U”) uses an even more
restricted sample of “recent hires” for whom the employment status is observed
within the core waves and who were unemployed for at least one month prior to
re-gaining employment. Since the retrospective question is asked in the early waves
of a panel, this leaves relatively little room to observe the unemployment status of
those workers in the core wave dataset (which is a requirement to be included in
this group). For these samples we use the 1984 up to 2001 panels.92
92For the most recent two panels, 2004 and 2008, we can ﬁnd a lower bound and an upper bound
on the non-employment spell, but typically not a precise monthly duration. When restricting the
1996 and 2001 panels to provide the same amount of information as the 2004 and 2008 panels (by

For a worker to be considered as an occupational mover, the current job starting
date must be within a one month interval around the implied start of the occupation,
or before.93Across all these sample we once again ﬁnd that non-employed workers’
self-reported occupational mobility is high. Combining retrospective employer and
occupational tenure information implies that roughly about 40% of non-employed
workers accept jobs in a new line of work. Average mobility of recently hired work-
ers in columns (c) and (d), which uses recall of more recent non-employment spells,
and allows us to distinguish tenures more clearly, is broadly in line with columns (a)
and (b), where the former have a reported mobility in 35-42% range, versus 42-46%
for all workers in columns (a) and (b). Retrospective measures of occupational mo-
bility do subtly differ from the ones derived by comparing occupational codes, ﬁrst
because they reﬂect the workers’ own assessment of ’line of work’/occupations,
rather than the Census’, but also because the occupational tenure in question can
reasonably refer to jobs even before the previous job. Nevertheless, we ﬁnd that
the extent of occupational mobility obtained from individuals reporting a “different
kind/line of work” aligns very well with the adjusted rate of occupational mobil-
ity for the non-employed obtained by comparing the major occupations of the 2000
SOC or the 1990 SOC described in Section 1.1 of this appendix. This conﬁrms that,
after a gap in their employment history, about two out of ﬁve workers ends up in a
different line of work than they had before.94
Table 39 shows that the retrospective occupational mobility rate is also high
across several demographic groups. In particular, both male and female workers
have mobility rates around 40%, with an average mobility rate across the four sam-
ples that is higher for males. Interestingly, in some measures (for example in column
(d)) this gap appears meaningful, but on the other hand is smaller when considering
women who were classiﬁed as “attached” (in column (b)). Occupational mobility
ignoring start and end months of the previous jobs), we ﬁnd that the loss of information appears to
be small.
93Here we use a one month ‘margin’ to reﬂect one month of rounding error. The impact of includ-
ing an additional margin of one month is small, ranging from 0 to 3 percentage points change in the
occupational mobility rate at most. Below we use an alternative measure to check the robustness of
our measure.
94The retrospective question, is consistent with the interpretation of occupational mobility in the
main paper, where an occupational change is a start of a new career. In the calibration, this occurs in
44% of unemployment spells, according to the retrospective question, workers start something they
have not done before in about 40% of the cases.
192

[Page 194 of 269]
upon re-employment is substantial for workers from all education groups, though
again we can discern an education gradient, with college workers more often taking
re-employment in a line of work they held before. Finally, we ﬁnd that the perhaps
clearest differences in the occupational mobility rates by demographic characteris-
tics is across age groups, where the mobility rate decreases signiﬁcantly as workers
get older. Nevertheless, the mobility rate of prime-aged workers also remains high,
between 32.5 and 39%.95
It is important to note some differences across panels. For example, how the du-
ration of non-employment was solicited: directly as a duration or implied by the
starting and end dates of a job. In the 1984 panel individuals are asked explicitly
for the duration of the non-employment spell and the tenure on the job, rather than
reporting start and end months of employment, as done in more recent panels. An-
other difference is that the labor market topical module is asked in the interview
of wave 2 between 1987 and 1991 panels, but from the 1992 panel onwards in the
interview of wave 1. The SIPP was redesigned in 1996 panel and carried over to
2001 panel. Generally, a large part the new design of 1996 is carried forward till
the 2008 panel. However, in the labor market topical module there are changes that
lead the 2004 and 2008 panels to differ from the 1996 and 2001 panels and make it
much harder to determine the combination of non-employment duration and occu-
pational mobility. For this reason these former panels are omitted from the analysis.
The setup of the labor market history questionnaire is perhaps the most distinct in
the 1984 panel; however, it also contains the most direct question on the employ-
ment gap. Implied occupational mobility in this panel is somewhat higher than in
other panels, while its sample size is relatively large relative to the other panels in
the 1980s. Excluding it from the analysis means that the average implied occupa-
tional mobility across the remaining panels is lower, typically, by 1-4 percentage
points. For example, mobility of all workers (pooled) in the ﬁrst column, drops to
42.9%. Nevertheless, even excluding this panel, mobility is high, and broadly shared
across many demographic groups.
95The relative drop across age groups is somewhat stronger in our retrospective measure than in
the occupational mobility based on comparing codes, falling between 12 to 16 percentage points
from young to prime-aged workers. A potential explanation is the difference between comparing
occupational codes after an unemployment spell with the occupational code just before, rather than
asking whether, at some point in their entire working life, workers have had a line of work similar to
the current one. The relevance of this difference, intuitively, seems larger for older workers.

B.6.2 Self-reported occupational mobility and non-employment spell
duration
We now turn to analyse the mobility-duration proﬁle that arises from the retrospec-
tive measure of occupational mobility. Table 40 reports the results of linear proba-
bility models based on the implied occupational mobility rates obtained from self-
reported occupational tenure as a function of the time in non-employment between
jobs and a set of controls. These include an indicator variable for gender, a quadratic
in age and categorical variables for the completed duration of the non-employment
spell (where we take 1-4 months as the baseline category) and for workers’ edu-
cational levels (where we take high school graduate as the baseline category). We
also add controls for previous and current occupational tenure and occupation of
origin and destination, include a linear time trend and grouped-panel ﬁxed effects
to control for differences between SIPP panel setups.
In panel A we consider the retrospective information on the (most recent) spell
of non-employment of all workers, if they have gone through non-employment af-
ter entering the labor force. We observe that self-reported occupational mobility
increases with non-employment duration, roughly at a rate of one percentage point
per month. These results are well in line with the results presented in the main text,
for occupational mobility according to changes in the occupational code.
In the ﬁrst column we relate the probability of self-reported change in occupation
to the reported time between employment. We only allow for a linear time trend in
occupational mobility. In the second column, we add controls for gender, race, a
quartic in age and marital status, and grouped panel ﬁxed effects. This hardly af-
fects the slope of the mobility-duration proﬁle. In the third column, we include the
occupational code on the job previous to the non-employment spell. Interestingly,
the earlier panels of the SIPP , up to 1993, include both a question on occupational
tenure and the occupation code of this previous job. Controlling for the ‘source’ oc-
cupation reduces slightly the point estimate of the mobility - duration proﬁle, but
not in a signiﬁcant way. In the fourth and ﬁfth columns we repeat these regressions
for the smaller subset of workers who do not separate for “personal reasons”, i.e.
our “attached” sample discussed above. Again, we see that a broadly similar pic-
ture appearing, again without much difference when controlling for demographics,

grouped panel ﬁxed effects and source occupations.
In panel B, we concentrate on recent hires, i.e. those who started a job, after non-
employment, within 6 months of the interview on their labor market history. We
apply the same sample selection criteria as discussed above. The smaller sample size
means that the gradients of mobility with duration are more imprecisely estimated.
Nevertheless, a similar broad (but less precise) conclusion can be drawn. There is a
positive slope of mobility with duration that is not too steep, with point estimates
well in line with panel A and the occupational code-driven mobility in the main
text. Although care has to be taken, given the size of the standard errors, we observe
that the point estimates of the slope of the mobility-duration proﬁle of all workers
hired after non-employment is somewhat lower, while for those who have been
unemployed the point estimates of the slope is rather close to panel A of Table 40,
195

[Page 197 of 269]
and the main text. Although not shown here, the coefﬁcients on education, age,
gender paint a similar relative picture as Table 39.
The above results show that occupational mobility is high at any non-employment
duration and exhibits a moderate increase with the duration of the non-employment
spell, where between 50% and 60% of workers with at least 9 months of non-employment
duration return to previous occupations at re-employment. These are very similar
characteristics as the ones found in our main analysis based on the comparison of
occupational codes. Once again we ﬁnd a prominent decline in the probability of
an occupational change with age. We also ﬁnd small differences in the probability
of an occupational change between males and females and across education levels,
with the exception of the group of recently hired from unemployment (as in Table
39). Note that including indicator variables for the occupations of origin and desti-
nation (as done in 1b) does not alter greatly the outcomes for non-employment spell
durations and other coefﬁcients, with the exception of the point estimates for the
education coefﬁcients. This suggests that speciﬁc occupational identities are not the
main drivers of both non-employment duration and occupational mobility of work-
ers. This is once again in line with the conclusions of Section 1.5 in this appendix.
B.6.3 The cyclicality of self-reported occupational mobility for the
non-employed
We now turn to investigate the cyclicality of our occupational mobility measure.
When comparing the occupational mobility of workers recently hired from non-
employment across different panels, Figure 52 suggests a procyclical pattern. This
ﬁgure depicts, for each panel, the occupational mobility implied by the answer to
the occupational tenure question of those who were recently hired after a period of
unemployment. Note that the retrospective work history questions are only asked
at the beginning of a panel, so if we were to focus on recent hires we would not have
a complete quarterly time series. Rather, we measure this mobility at various points
over the business cycle. In the graph, we show the observations in the quarter in
which the “recent hiring" typically took place for each panel. One can observe that,
with the switch from overlapping panels to sequential panels in 1996, the length
between the points for which we have observations widens signiﬁcantly over time.
196
----------------------------------------

[Page 198 of 269]
We focus on those panels which share their survey design with at least one other
panel, so that we can also compare within survey design. In particular, the 1987-
1993 panels share the same retrospective questioning, but we separate the 1990-1993
panels because we can use the re-coded ﬁrm identities to reduce measurement error
in these panels. However, this has only a very minor impact on the recent hires,
as ﬁrm identiﬁers do not play a large role in extracting the implied occupational
mobility from self-reported occupational tenure. Potentially more important is that
the timing of the retrospective question changes from wave 2 to wave 1 between
the 1990-91 panels and the 1992-93 panels. This means that we observe less of the
non-employment spell inside the core waves (and consequently have less monthly
observations in which we could distinguish unemployment), which may have rele-
vance for our “hires from unemployment” measure. As noted, from the 1996 panel
onwards, the SIPP was redesigned such that we can only use the occupational tenure
question to gauge occupational mobility of those who are recently hired.96

ity over the entire time series. In times of low unemployment such as 1996 but also
late 1989 to early 1990, self-reported occupational mobility is high, while in times of
recession (high, or at least rather rapidly increasing unemployment) as in late 1990
to early 1991 and 2001, mobility is lower than in preceding “good times”. Second,
to assuage concerns about changes in survey design, we observe that the aforemen-
tioned observation occurs precisely across panels that share the same survey design,
i.e. the 1990-1991 panels, and the 1996-2001 panels.

is our alternative mobility indicator that excludes cases where occupational between 1-4

All regressions include a linear time trend. Demographic controls are a quartic in age, a
gender dummy, race and education dummies. panel FE v1 has dummies for the following

We conﬁrm the procyclicality of occupational mobility using regression analysis.

able again takes the value of one if the worker reported a new line of work and zero
otherwise. Our baseline is again occupational mobility as inferred from the occupa-
tional tenure question, where all those who have an occupational tenure higher than
the current job tenure (allowing for a month of ambiguity) are considered stayers.
In our alternative measure (denoted with ?, in columns (vi-viii) and (xiv-xvi)), we
drop those observations who were coded as stayers but reported an occupational
198

tenure within four months of the current job tenure.
When only controlling for a linear time trend, in columns (i) and (ix), we ob-
serve that times of high unemployment, as captured by positive deviations from
HP-ﬁltered log unemployment trend, are times of lower self-reported occupational
mobility. This is also observed for the alternative measure of self-reported occupa-
tional mobility, in columns (vi) and (xiv). In panel A, we take all recent hires, while
in panel B we consider all recent hires for whom we observed a period of unem-
ployment. Naturally, the number of observations in panel B is lower, which makes
our inference harder. Nevertheless, we also observe a procyclical response of self-
reported occupational mobility, statistically signiﬁcant at the 10%, having clustered
standard errors at the quarter level. Restricting stayers to have an occupational
tenure more than four months longer than current job tenure leads to a slightly
stronger observed procyclical responsiveness.
As noted above, the SIPP’s survey design changed over time, which may affect
our results. To address this issue, we consider two variants of dummies for sets of
panels that share the same survey design. As noted above, the 1990 to 1993 panel
share the same survey design apart from a change of the timing of the retrospective
question, from wave 2 to wave 1. This can be relevant for observing unemployment
during the preceding non-employment spell. Therefore, in the ﬁrst version (v1), we
add four dummies for grouped panels, one for the 1984 panel, one for both 1987 and
1988 panel, one for the 1990-1993 panels, and one for the 1996-2001 panels. In the
second version (v2), we add two separate dummies for the 1990-1991 panels and the
1992-1993 panels.
We observe that the responsiveness to the unemployment is much stronger in
(v2). This responsiveness is driven by the variation within pairs of two panels,
which puts a lot of weight on the behavior of the 1990 vs 1991 panel (and also on
the 1996 vs 2001) panel, and less on the lower-frequency (but still business-cycle)
behavior of the time series of observations in the subsequent recovery of the 1991
recession as measured relative to the pre-recession 1990 panel and full-recession 1991
panel. While these responses are statistically signiﬁcant in both panels, we ﬁnd it
conservative to prefer v1and consider results in these two panels on a similar base
to those in 1992 and 1993 panels, and estimate the responsiveness of mobility also
taking into account that response to unemployment in the recovery of the 1991 re-

cession.
Overall, controlling for grouped panel effects (v1) does not change the estimated
empirical responses much relative to e.g. columns (i) and (ix), while grouped panel
effect (v1) leads to stronger procyclical responses. Comparing the estimates in panel
B to panel A we do not observe meaningful differences in the point estimates, even
though the underlying samples are smaller, with this naturally affecting the preci-
sion of our inference. Controlling for demographic characteristics does not change
the empirical responsiveness to cyclical unemployment, fully in line with the results
of the occupational code-based analysis. Taken together, it appears clear that occu-
pational mobility of recent hires from non-employment, inferred from retrospective
questions on occupational tenure and job history, is procyclical. For those hired af-
ter unemployment, the evidence points in the same direction, though tends to be
statistically weaker as a result of a low numbers.

Cyclical Shift of the Mobility-duration proﬁle Finally, we investigate whether
the self-reported occupational mobility proﬁle with non-employment duration shifts
down with recessions and whether on average exhibits a similar slope as in the
pooled cross-sectional sample. Table 42 shows that this is indeed the case. We
observe that the modest positive slope on the non-employment duration is pre-
served when including the HP-ﬁltered log of the unemployment rate. Controlling
for non-employment duration largely leaves the empirical cyclical responsiveness
unaffected. This result again mimics the result for the code-based mobility mea-
sures as they change with duration and the cycle.
B.6.4 Retrospective Self-reported Occupational Mobility – Conclu-
sion
In this section, we have investigate occupational mobility after non-employment
spells using very different data than in the main text. None of the occupational in-
formation used in the occupational code-based measures of the main text has been
used in the measures in this section. Further, in the code-based measures of the main
text, census coders are the judge of occupational change, while in the retrospective
occupational tenure, this judgement is made by the interview subject. It is then
comforting to observe that both measures line up well. First, according to workers,
they are starting in a new line of work after nonemployment in about 40% cases.
Second, with a longer nonemployment duration comes an increased tendency to
change one’s line of work. However, this tendency is modest, around 6 p.p. higher
after 6 months of unemployment, fully consistent with the occupational-code results
in the main text and in Section 1 of this appendix. Third, when cyclical unemploy-
ment is high, self-reported occupational mobility tends to be cyclically low. Fourth,
controlling for the business cycle, we still observe a modest increase of self-reported
mobility with nonemployment duration, again keeping with the pattern of code-
based occupational mobility documented in the main text.
Once again our estimates show that the probability of an occupational change
for the non-employed is procyclical. This holds true for both samples and with or
without controlling for the duration of the non-employment spell. In particular,
for the sample of recent hires that were unemployed for at least one month before
201
----------------------------------------

[Page 203 of 269]
re-employment, we still observe the moderate increase in the probability of an occu-
pational mobility with the duration of non-employment. Likewise, controlling for
destination occupations, we also ﬁnd strong procyclicality in the probability of an
occupational change. This suggests that the procyclicality is not driven by shifts in
the occupational destinations over the business cycle. This is once again inline with
the results of Section 4 of this appendix.
B.7 Data Construction
B.7.1 Survey of Income and Program Participation
The Survey of Income and Programme Participation (SIPP) is a longitudinal data
set based on a representative sample of the US civilian non-institutionalized pop-
ulation. It is divided into multi-year panels. Each panel comprise a new sample
of individuals and is subdivided into four rotation groups. Individuals in a given
rotation group are interviewed every four months such that information for each
rotation group is collected for each month. At each interview individuals are asked,
among other things, about their employment status as well as their occupations and
industrial sectors during employment in the last four months.97
The SIPP offers a high frequency interview schedule and aims explicitly at col-
lecting information on worker turnover. Further, its panel dimension allows us to
follow workers over time and construct uninterrupted spells of unemployment (or
non-employment) that started with an employment to unemployment transitions
and ended in a transition to employment. Its panel dimension also allows us to
analyse these workers’ occupational mobility patterns conditional on unemploy-
ment (or non-employment) duration and their post occupational mobility outcomes
as outlined in Section 2 in the main text.
Survey design and use of data. We consider the period 1983 - 2013. To cover this
period we use 13 panels in total: the 1984-1988, 1990-1993, 1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008
panels. For the 1984-1988 and 1990-1993 panels we have used the Full Panel ﬁles as
the basic data sets, but appended the monthly weights obtained from the individual
97See http://www.census.gov/sipp/ for a detailed description of the data set.
202
----------------------------------------

[Page 204 of 269]
waves (sometimes referred to as core wave data). Until the 1993 panel we use the
occupational information from the core waves. We do this for two reasons: (i) the
full panel ﬁles do not always have an imputation ﬂag for occupations; and (ii) be-
tween the 1990 and 1993 panels ﬁrm identities were retrospectively recoded, based
on core wave ﬁrm identiﬁers. For our study it is important to be clear to which ﬁrm
the occupation belongs. We exclude the 1989 SIPP panel because the US Census
Bureau does not provide the Full Panel ﬁle for the 1989 data set and this panel was
discontinued after only three waves (12 months). Since we want to be conservative
regarding censoring, we opted for not using this data set. This is at a minor cost
as the 1988 panel covers up to September 1989 and the 1990 panel collects data as
from October 1989. For the 1996, 2001, 2004 and 2008 panels there is no longer a
Full Panel ﬁle nor a need for one. One can simply append the individual wave in-
formation using the individual identiﬁer “lgtkey” and merge in the person weights
of those workers for whom we have information from the entire panel (or an en-
tire year). In this case, the job identiﬁer information is also clearly speciﬁed. Two
important differences between the post and pre-1996 panels are worth noting. The
pre-1996 panels have an overlapping structure and a smaller sample size. Starting
with the 1996 panel the sample size of each panel doubled in size and the over-
lapping structure was dropped. We have constructed our pre-1996 indicators by
obtaining the average value of the indicators obtained from each of the overlapping
panels.
The SIPP’s sample design implies that in allpanels the ﬁrst and last three months
have less than four rotation groups and hence a smaller sample size. For this rea-
son, in our time series analysis, we only consider months that have information for
all four rotation groups. For statistics for which the distribution of unemployment
duration matters we require that workers have at least 14 months of labor market
history at the moment of re-employment in their corresponding SIPP panel. If nec-
essary (and discussed in detail below), we impose further restrictions to deal with
censored spells in order to generate a representative distribution of unemployment
spells for at least up to one year. This restriction addresses that e.g. short completed
unemployment spells typically have lower mobility, while in the ﬁrst waves of a
panel spells started and completed within the panel are necessarily of short dura-
tion. This is even more important when constructing the job ﬁnding rates, espe-
203
----------------------------------------

[Page 205 of 269]
cially when we want to focus on the job ﬁnding rates in completed spells for which
we know the occupational mobility outcomes. For the cumulative survival proﬁle
in unemployment, we consider all spells that at their start have at least 32 months
of subsequent continuous presence in the sample and restrict these observations to
be in the ﬁrst 4 waves of the panel. For job ﬁnding rates in the time series, which
are based on incomplete spells, we require that all workers whose job ﬁnding rate
is measured at duration xremain continuously in the sample for at least 19- xmore
months.
The data also shows the presence of seams effects between waves, where tran-
sitions are more likely to occur at a seam (i.e. between waves, and therefore at 4,8,
12. . . months) than based on other characteristics, e.g. duration. When we consider
time series and given the above restrictions, there is always one rotation at the seam
in every month we consider which effectively smoothes out the clustering at the
seam. In the case of the duration statistics for which the seam effect matters, we
either consider observations in 4 months bins (e.g. survival at 4, 8, 12, 16 months of
unemployment) or use the standard methods to reducing the seam bias by smooth-
ing out the survival rates or considering “cumulative” mobility rates with duration
(see e.g. for the mobility-duration proﬁle reported in Section 2.2 of the main text).
We use the person weights per wave (“wpﬁnwgt”, and equivalent), but normal-
ize these such that the average weight within a panel is equal to one. This is done
because the size of panels is not constant, and we do not want to weigh panels with
less observations more heavily as within a wave of a panel “wpﬁnwgt” adds up to
population totals and thus is higher on average when sample size is smaller. We
think of our normalization as a reasonably agnostic approach that keeps the relative
weights within a panel intact, but also takes into account the number of available
observations.
Sample selection and labor market status. For the 1984-2008 panels, we con-
sider all workers between 18 and 65 years of age who are not in self-employment
or in the armed forces nor in the agricultural occupations.98We measure an indi-
98As agricultural occupations could be miscoded nonagricultural occupations and vice versa, in
our code-error corrected measure, we take agricultural workers according to reported occupational
codes into account, apply our correction method, and remove agricultural workers after correction
from our sample and associated statistics.
204

[Page 206 of 269]
vidual’s monthly labor force status in the SIPP using two sources of information.
The ﬁrst one relies on the labor force status reported at the second week of each
month. The second relies on the monthly employment status recode. Using these
two sources (and using the SIPP 2001 wording as an example) we consider a worker
to be employed during a month if the individual reported in the second week of that
month that he/she was “with job/business - working”, “with job/business - not on
layoff, absent without pay” or “with job/business - on layoff, absent without pay”.
The category “with a job” (Census 2008) is assigned if the person either (a) worked
as paid employees (or worked in their own business or profession or on their own
farm or worked without pay in a family business or farm) or (b) “were temporarily
[emphasis added] absent from work either with or without pay.” Thus, the employment
status recode category “with job/business - on layoff, absent without pay” appears
to capture temporary layoffs. Note that as a result our deﬁnition of employment
differs from the CPS deﬁnition of employment. As the SIPP documentation points
out: “ “With a job” includes those who were temporarily absent from a job because
of layoff and those waiting to begin a new job In 30 days; in the CPS these persons
are not considered employed.”
We consider a worker to be employed if the individual reported in the monthly
employment status recode variable that he/she was “with a job entire month, worked
all weeks", but also when “with a job all month, absent from work without pay 1+
weeks, absences not due to layoff”, or “with a job all month, absent from work with-
out pay 1+ weeks, absences due to layoff”. If workers have spent part of the month
in employment and part of the month in unemployment, workers are nonemployed
only if they are nonemployed in week 2 andhave been nonemployed for at least
four weeks in total. That is, those who have less than a month of nonemployment
in week 2 are still counted as employed. If the worker is “no job/business - looking
for work or on layoff” during one of the weeks in nonemployment (i.e. in the "no
job/business") state, we consider the worker to be unemployed. We have chosen
this classiﬁcation, because we want entry into unemployment to capture the serious
weakening of the link with the previous ﬁrm of employment, rather than to be a def-
inite period of nonproduction after which the worker would return to the previous
employer. The restriction of nonemployment for at least four weeks is meant to fur-
ther limit the role of short-term absences from the same ﬁrm and temporary layoffs.
205
----------------------------------------

[Page 207 of 269]
This is motivated by the analysis of Fujita and Moscarini (2017), who document that
many workers with very short unemployment spells return to their previous em-
ployer. We want to focus on those unemployed who at least consider employment in
other ﬁrms and possibly other occupations.

Figure 53: Unemployment Rate SIPP (red, our measures) and BLS-CPS (blue, ofﬁ-
cial)
With these restrictions, our measured unemployment rate is somewhat lower
than the ofﬁcial unemployment rate. In Figure 53, we plot the unemployment rate
in our SIPP sample, constructed according to our deﬁnition, next to the standard
(CPS-based) unemployment rate from the BLS. The left panel displays the unem-
ployment rate in the SIPP when excluding those quarters in which panels phase
in or out. In this case all quarters considered are symmetric with respect to seams
between waves: each month there is at least one rotation group which switches in-
terview wave. The right panel considers only observations that have been in the
sample for at least 14 months. This necessarily means bigger gaps between panels,
but addresses issues of left-censoring when considering complete unemployment
spells for which we can observe the occupational mobility. This is important when
e.g. considering the distribution of unemployment durations of completed spells as
at the beginning of the panel the only completed unemployment spells are neces-
sarily those of short duration, which have a lower occupational mobility rate. Not
taking this into account would lead to mistaken time series patterns of occupational
mobility of the unemployed.
206
----------------------------------------

[Page 208 of 269]
Both panels of Figure 53 show that our restrictions lower the unemployment
rate by about 1.5pp. This level effect is nearly uniform over time and over the cycle.
That is, the time-series evolution of our measure of unemployment follows BLS un-
employment closely, while the level effect is nearly unaffected by the business cycle.
If anything, our measure responds slightly stronger to the business cycle (a 1pp rise
in the ofﬁcial rate raises our unemployment measure by 1.04pp, this is small but
statistically signiﬁcant). The correlation between our unemployment measure and
the BLS measure (for those months for which we have our SIPP measure of unem-
ployment) is 98-99% for both unemployment series in Figure 53. This implies that
the cyclical pattern in unemployment, to a very large extent, originates in the set
of unemployed we consider in this paper (see also Hornstein, 2013, and Ahn and
Hamilton, 2019).
We further check that these properties also hold when we restrict unemployment
to those who start and endunemployment within the SIPP sample, taking care to ad-
dress both the left- and right-censoring involved in this measure. The correlation of
this unemployment rate (smoothed, because of the smaller set of observations) with
the BLS unemployment rate is over 94% when considering nonemployment spells
that include months of unemployment, and 93% when considering pure unemploy-
ment spells, where workers are unemployed in every month of nonemployment.
Assigning “source”/“destination” - occupations to unemployed workers. The
SIPP collects information on a maximum of two jobs an individual might hold si-
multaneously. For each of these jobs we have information on, among other things,
hours worked, total earnings, 3-digit occupation and 3-digit industry codes. We
drop all observations with imputed occupations (and industries). If the individual
held two jobs simultaneously, we consider the main job as the one in which the
worker spent more hours. We break a possible tie in hours by using total earnings.
The job with the highest total earnings will then be considered the main job. In most
cases individuals report to work in one job at any given moment. In the vast ma-
jority of cases in which individuals report two jobs, the hours worked are sufﬁcient
to identify the main job. Once the main job is identiﬁed, the worker is assigned the
207
----------------------------------------

[Page 209 of 269]
corresponding two, three or four digit occupation.99
Each unemployment spell that is started and ﬁnished inside the panel can be
assigned a “source”-occupation (main occupation right before the start of the un-
employment spell), and a “destination”-occupation (main occupation right after be-
coming employed again). If the occupation code is missing just before the unem-
ployment spell (e.g. due to imputation) and an occupation code is reported in a pre-
vious wave, while employment is continuous from the time that the occupation was
reported until the start of the unemployment spell under consideration, we carry the
latter occupation forward as source occupation. A worker is an occupation mover if
source and destination occupations do not coincide. We thus conservatively count
the following situation also as an occupational stay: the worker is simultaneously
employed in two ﬁrms at the moment the worker becomes unemployed, and ﬁnds
a job afterwards in an occupation that matches the occupation in one of the two
previous jobs, even when it matches the job with less hours. The effect on the oc-
cupational mobility statistics of counting as occupational stays the unemployment
spells with two simultaneous jobs at either side is small.
We construct the occupational mobility statistics from transitions of the form: at
least a month in employment (with a non-imputed occupational code), followed by
an unemployment spell which has a duration of at least a month, followed by at least
a month in employment (with a non-imputed occupational code). We label these
transitions as EUE transitions. We also consider transitions of the form: at least a
month in employment (with a non-imputed occupational code), followed by a non-
employment spell which has a duration of at least a month and involved at least
one month of unemployment. We call these E-NUN-E transitions, or NUN-spells
of nonemployment. Further convexifying the space between EUE and E-NUN-E,
we also consider spells that started with a EU transition, i.e. employment directly
followed by unemployment (though later the worker can report to stop looking for
work), and those that ended with UE transition. We label these transitions as E-UN-
E, E-NU-E, and if both restrictions apply, E-UNU-E transitions. We also tried other
versions of the latter in which the full jobless spell was non-employed (ENE).
99For the 1990-1993 panels we correct the job identiﬁer variable following the procedure suggested
by Stinson (2003).
208

[Page 210 of 269]
Occupational Classiﬁcations. The SIPP uses the Census of Population Occupa-
tional System, which relates closely to the Standard Occupational Code (SOC). The
1984-1991 panels use the 1980 Census Occupational classiﬁcation, while the 1992-
1996 and 2001 panels use the 1990 Census Occupational classiﬁcations. These two
classiﬁcations differ only slightly between them. The 2004 and 2008 panels use the
2000 Census occupational classiﬁcation, which differs more substantially from the
previous classiﬁcations. We use David Dorn’s recoding of the 1980 and 2000 Census
Occupational Classiﬁcation (Dorn, 2009, and Autor and Dorn, 2013) into the 1990
Census Occupational Classiﬁcation to have a uniform coding system. In robustness
exercises, we instead use the IPUMS crosswalk to map the 1980 and 1990 Census
occupational system into the 2000 Census occupational system.
We aggregate the information on “broad” occupations (3-digit occupations) pro-
vided by the SIPP into “minor” and “major” occupational categories.100Measure-
ment error in occupational codes might give rise to spurious transitions, as dis-
cussed for example in Kambourov and Manovskii (2008, 2009) and Moscarini and
Thomsson (2007). We correct for coding error using the G-correction method we
propose in Supplementary Appendix A. The occupational categories of the classiﬁ-
cations used can be found in Tables 4 and 5 of that appendix.
Time series construction. We construct monthly time series for the unemploy-
ment rate, employment to unemployment transition rate (job separation rate), un-
employment to employment transition rate (job ﬁnding rate), occupational mobility
rates and the other measures described in the main text. Job ﬁnding rates are simply
UE t/Ut, the proportion of unemployed at time tthat moves to employment at time
t+1. Similarly, the separation rate is EUt/Et, the proportion of employed at time
tthat moves to unemployment at time t+1. We start measuring job ﬁnding and
separation rates at the ﬁrst month were we have information for all four rotation
groups.
For construction of de-trended time series we have to address the issue of gaps
(missing observations) in time series. There are a few quarters that are not covered
100In any of these classiﬁcations we have not included the Armed Forces. The 1980 and 1990 clas-
siﬁcations can be found at https://www.census.gov/people/io/ﬁles/techpaper2000.pdf. The 2000
classiﬁcation can be found in http://www.bls.gov/soc/socguide.htm. Additional information about
these classiﬁcations can be found at http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/faqs.html.

at all by the 1984-2008 SIPP panels: 2000Q2-2000Q3, and 2008Q1. The gaps around
these times can become larger, and new gaps can be created, when censoring issues
cause us to drop further quarters from the analysis. We discuss this in more detail
below.
To cover the missing observations we interpolate the series using the TRAMO
(Time Series Regression with ARIMA Noise, Missing Observations and Outliers)
procedure developed by Gomez and Maravall (1999), with interpolation of missing
observations through regression (“Additive Outlier Approac”).101In our baseline
cyclical timeseries, de-trended data series are produced with after HP-ﬁltering the
resulting (logged) time series, with smoothing parameter 1600.
Two aspects are especially important for the time series of the propensity of hires
from U to start in a new occupation: (1) the code error correction, and (2) addressing
censoring issues, to counter noise and bias due to shifts in the duration distributions
between adjacent quarters that are orthogonal to the business cycle.
We select only observations of individuals who have been in sample for more
than 14 interviews and are hired beyond wave 4. Given this, we correct for coding
error at the level of quarter (completed) spell duration. This means that, for all
hires from unemployment with a given completed duration in a given quarter, we
calculate the transition matrix of occupational mobility and correct it using the ap-
propriate G(code-error) correction matrix. We then calculate the cumulative mobil-
ity of all hires with unemployment durations up to (and including) 12 months, and
in an alternative measure, up to and including 14 months. We ﬁnd little difference
across these two measures, and hence report only the former measure. The same
corrected observations at the level of duration quarter will subsequently be used
to calculate the mobility-duration proﬁle shift from times of low unemployment to
times of high unemployment.
While time series gaps are small for many statistics, this issue is more important
101See also Fujita, et al. (2007) for a similar procedure using the SIPP . Tramo/Seats is a parametric,
ARIMA model based method (AMB), that works in two steps. In the ﬁrst step (TRAMO) the series
is interpolates missing observations and deals with outliers. The second step (SEATS), among other
things, decomposes the time series resulting from step 1 into e.g. a trend-cycle, an irregular, and a
seasonal component. Seasonal adjustment is broadly similar to the Census Bureau’s X12 procedure,
and is used e.g. by Eurostat. (Hood et al. (Hood, Ashley, Finley, US Census Bureau: “An Empirical
Evaluation of the Performance of Tramo/Seats on Simulated Series”), who also argue that SEATS
does better than X12-ARIMA with longer time series that have large irregular components.)

Table 43: Quarters included in time series for overall occupational mobility rate of
all unemployed (with unemployment duration between 1-14 months
for the average occupational mobility of all hires from unemployment (of 12-14
months). The restriction to wave 5 and beyond means that, by default, we leave out
those observed unemployment spells that arise from workers losing their jobs and
being hired within the ﬁrst 16 months of each panel. As argued above, this is to
make sure that we capture the nearly full duration distribution of unemployment
at each quarter considered in our analysis. This is especially important here as not
doing so would generate a downward bias in the occupational mobility rates at the
beginning of a panel, which is particularly strong in e.g. 2004. In addition, we take
into account that, given the rotating survey design, some further quarters early in
the panel do not have a seam in each month (this is also a relevant issue for the
job ﬁnding and separation time series). We are also conservative on this issue and
disregard those quarters as well.
We also note that censoring issues may arise at the very end of the panel, where
again a quarter may contain varying proportion of monthly observations that are
the ﬁnal seam. We observe that in practice, some of these “ending” quarters have
duration distributions that are very different from the duration distributions in pre-
vious quarters. As we show below, this variation is signiﬁcantly larger and more
abrupt than changes that appear to move with business cycle conditions. For this
reason, we also exclude the last quarter of the 1988 panel and all panels from the
1993 panel onwards, with the exception of the 2001 panel. The quarters which are
used for our analysis are then given in Table 43. These observations span a number
of different moments during multiple business cycles and therefore the cyclical pat-
terns can indeed be clear and signiﬁcant, as is shown in Section 2.5 of the main text
and this appendix.
To visualize the impact of censoring, Figure 54 presents the duration distribution

Here we can indeed observe the some of the last and ﬁrst of the quarters con-
sidered are affected by these (censoring) issues and hence are excluded from our
analysis. We also observe that the remaining duration distributions are relatively
stable across individual quarters, with the amount of quarter-to-quarter variation
dropping with the 1996 panel and thereafter. This occurs because the sample sizes
per panel are larger, while the overlapping nature of panels beforehand imply that
some additional noise is generated when panels are phased in and out, while other
panels are ongoing. We also tried to further restrict the sample to exclude observa-
tions from these phase-in and -out, but the impact of this on time series patterns is
minor.
Aggregate Series Productivity, Unemployment, Vacancy Series For output
per worker, we take nonfarm business output from the Major Sector Productivity
and Costs section of Bureau of Labor Statistics (series id: PRS85006043), and divide
this by the sum of employment of private industry wage and salary workers (not
in agriculture) and employment of self-employed unincorporated workers in these
sectors (series LNS12032189Q and lns12032192q, respectively) Unemployment rates
in the cyclical analysis are BLS Unemployment rates (UNRATE in the St. Louis Fred
data). We take the vacancy data from extended Help-Wanted Index constructed by
Regis Barnichon.
Repeat Mobility In our baseline repeat mobility measures, we concentrate on
pure u-spells that follow pure u-spells within a SIPP panel, for workers that are at
least 4 years in sample. To avoid including seasonal unemployment in our mea-
sures (which are not informative about attachment as interpreted in the model), we
exclude construction and agricultural workers. We are left with 610 observations of
repeat unemployment. For our NUN measures, we consider NUN-spell following
102One can distinguish some cyclical patterns directly, clearest perhaps when comparing across
panels, where the red bands (hires after 6 months of unemployment) in the early 1990s panels are to
the left of those in the 1996 panel, and likewise for the 2001 SIPP vs the 1996 and 2004 SIPP , and the
2008 vs the 2004 SIPP , signifying more long-term unemployment in the “recession” 1990-1993, 2001,
and 2008 SIPP panels.

[Page 215 of 269]
NUN-spells with the same restrictions, leaving 1306 observations of repeat unem-
ployment. We average the measures that consider the occupation of intermediate
employment at the beginning and end of that spell. We correct coding errors using
the procedure described in footnote 13 in the main text. Finally, to gauge occupa-
tional moving, we exclude any observations of return movers.
B.7.2 Panel Survey of Income Dynamics
Following Kambourov and Manovskii (2008) sample restrictions, we consider the
1968-1997 period as during these years the PSID interviews were carried out annu-
ally. We also consider males head of households between the ages of 23-61 years
who were not self- or dual-employed and were not public sector works. This sam-
ple restriction then gives 1,643 employed individuals in the year 1968 and 2,502
employed individuals in 1997. In an alternative sample we also included women,
younger workers and self or dual-employed workers with no meaningful change in
our main results.
To construct the across-employer occupational mobility rate we compute the frac-
tion of employed workers who’s occupational code differs between years tand
t+1 and have reported an employer change between these years, divided by the
number of employed workers in year tthat have reported an employer change be-
tween years tand t+1. As Kambourov and Manovskii (2009), to identify employer
changes in the PSID we use Brown and Lights’ (1992) Partition T method. As ro-
bustness we also use Brown and Lights’ (1992) Partition 24T method. To identify
employer changes using these two methods we followed exactly the same proce-
dure as speciﬁed in Appendix A1 of Kambourov and Manovskii (2009). In addition,
we used Hospicio’s (2015) method to identiﬁed employer changes in the PSID, as
described in Hospido (2015), Section 3.2. We ﬁnd that our conclusions are not af-
fected by the method used.
When constructing the ENE occupational mobility rate we consider (i) those
workers who were employed at the interview date in year t 1, non-employed at
the interview date in year tand once again employed at the interview date in year
t+1; and (ii) those workers employed at the interview dates in years tand t+1 but
who declared that they experienced an involuntary employer change during these
214
----------------------------------------

[Page 216 of 269]
two interviews. In an alternative speciﬁcation we also added those workers who
were employed at the interview date in year t 2, non-employed at the interview
date in years t 1 and tand once again employed at the interview date in year t+1.
Given the small number of workers in the latter category the results hardly change.
We follow Stevens (1997) and Hospido (2015) and classify an involuntary em-
ployer change as those cases were the worker declared a job separation due to busi-
ness or plant closing, due to being laid off or were ﬁred or their temporary job ended.
We also added an “other” category as a reason why workers left their employers to
increase the number of observations. This category encompasses other reasons such
as military draft. Pooling together the “involuntary” and “others” categories and
computing the ENE occupational mobility rate gives very similar results. Further,
in constructing the ENE occupational mobility rates we were not able to eliminate
those workers in temporary layoff. The analysis of Fujita and Moscarini (2016), how-
ever, suggests that unemployed workers in temporary layoff will bias downwards
ourENE occupational mobility rates as these workers have a very high probability
of re-gaining employment in the same occupation.

Supplementary Appendix C: Theory
This appendix complements Section 3 of the paper. The ﬁrst part investigates,
using a simpliﬁed version of the model, (i) the conditions under which rest un-
employment arises and (ii) the cyclical properties of workers’ job separation and
occupational mobility decisions. The second part presents the equations describing
worker ﬂows in a BRE. The third part shows that the sub-market structure we im-
pose in paper endogenously arises from a competitive search model. The fourth part
provides the deﬁnition of a BRE, the proof of Proposition 2 (in the main text), the
proof of existence of the separation and reallocation cutoffs as well as of the results
presented in Sections 1 and 3 of this appendix.
C.1 Model Implications and Comparative Statics
We start by exploring the main implications of our theory: the occurrence of rest
unemployment and the cyclical properties of workers’ decisions to search across oc-
cupations and to separate from jobs. To keep the intuition as clear as possible we
study a simpliﬁed version of our model without occupational human capital ac-
cumulation, setting xh=1 for all h, and without occupational-wide productivity
shocks, setting po=1 for all o. These restrictions imply that all occupations are
identical, worker mobility across occupations is fully undirected and purely driven
by occupation-worker idiosyncratic shocks such that gross mobility equals excess
mobility. Further, within an occupation workers differ only in their z-productivities
and labor market segmentation is done along this dimension. Agents’ value func-
tions are still given by the Bellman equations described in Section 3.2 of the main
text, but now with state space (z,A)instead of (z,x,o,A,p). The net value of search-
ing across occupations then simpliﬁes to
R(A) = c+Zz
zWU(A,˜z)dF(˜z). (9)
In Carrillo-Tudela and Visschers (2013) we show that in this setting and assum-
ingF(z0jz)<F(z0j˜z)for all z,z0ifz>˜z, the value functions WU(A,z),WE(A,z),
J(A,z)and M(A,z), exist, are unique and increase in z. This implies that q(A,z)also
exists, is unique and increases with z. Further we show that if d+l(q(A,z))<1 for
218
----------------------------------------

[Page 220 of 269]
allA,z, in equilibrium there exists a unique cutoff function zsthat depends only on
A, such that d(A,z) =s(A,z) =1 if and only if z<zs(A), and d(A,z) =s(A,z) =
0 otherwise. Since R(A)is constant in z,WU(A,z)is increasing in z, and by the ex-
istence of a unique zsso is maxfl(q(A,zr(A)))(WE(A,zr(A)) WU(A,zr(A))), 0g,
there also exists a reallocation cutoff function zr(A)such that workers decide to
search across occupations if and only if z<zr(A)for every A, where zr(A)satisﬁes
R(A) =WU(A,zr(A)) + maxfl(q(A,zr(A)))(WE(A,zr(A)) WU(A,zr(A))), 0g.
(10)
Using this simpliﬁed framework we ﬁrst study the relative positions of the job
separation and reallocation cut-off functions and hence gain insights on the condi-
tions under which rest unemployment arises. We then study the slopes of these
cut-off functions and gain insights into the cyclicality of separations and (excess) oc-
cupational mobility in our model. Using our calibrated model we have veriﬁed that
the same properties as derived below apply to the more general setup considered
there.
C.1.1 The Occurrence of Rest Unemployment
We ﬁrst analyse how the value of waiting in unemployment and in employment
changes with c,band the persistence of the z-productivity process, and how these
changes determine the relative position of zrand zs. The simplest setting that cap-
tures a motive for waiting is one in which the z-productivity is redrawn randomly
with probability 0 <(1 g)<1 each period from cdf F(z)and Ais held constant.
Time-variation in zis essential here because a worker can decide to stay unemployed
in his occupation, even though there are no jobs currently available for him, when
there is a high enough probability that his z-productivity will become sufﬁciently
high in the future. All other features of the model remain the same, with the ex-
ception that we do not consider human capital accumulation or occupational-wide
productivity differences. In Section C.3.2 of this appendix we formulate the value
functions for this stationary environment and provide the proofs of Lemmas 1 and
2, below.
In this stationary setting, the expected value of an unemployed worker with pro-
219
----------------------------------------

[Page 221 of 269]
ductivity z, measured at the production stage, is given by
WU(A,z) = g
b+bmaxn
R(A),WU(A,z) +maxfl(q(A,z))(1 h)(M(A,z) WU(A,z)), 0go
+ ( 1 g)Ez[WU(A,z)]. (11)
Equation (11) shows that there are two ways in which an unemployed worker with
az<zscan return to production. Passively , he can wait until his z-productivity
increases exogenously. Or, actively , by paying cand sampling a new zin a different
occupation. In the case in which the worker prefers to wait, the inner max f.g=0
as the workers is below the separation cutoff and the outer max f.g=WU(A,z) =
WU(A,zs(A)), where the latter equality follows as in this simpliﬁed environment
thez-productivity process is assumed to be iid. In the case in which the worker
prefers to search across occupations the outer max f.g=R(A) =WU(A,zr(A)). The
difference WU(A,zs(A)) R(A), then captures the relative gain of waiting for one
period over actively sampling a new zimmediately. If WU(A,zs(A)) R(A)0,
then zszrand there is rest unemployment. If WU(A,zs(A)) R(A)<0, then zr>
zs, and endogenously separated workers immediately search across occupations.
Changing c,b, orgwill affect the relative gains of waiting, in employment and
in unemployment. In the following lemma we derive the direction of the change
inWU(A,zs(A)) R(A), where we take fully into account the feedback effect of
changes in c,b, orgon the match surplus M(A,z) WU(A,z)that arises due to the
presence of search frictions as discussed in Section 3.3 in the main text.
Lemma 1. Changes in c, b or gimply
d(WU(A,zs(A)) R(A))
dc>0,d(WU(A,zs(A)) R(A))
db>0,d(WU(A,zs(A)) R(A))
dg<0.
It is intuitive that raising cdirectly increases the relative gains of waiting as it
make occupational mobility more costly. An increase in c, however, also leads to a
larger match surplus because it reduces WU(A,z), making employed workers less
likely to separate and hence reducing rest unemployment. The lemma shows that,
overall, the ﬁrst effect dominates. A rise in blowers the effective cost of waiting,
while at the same time decreasing the match surplus by increasing WU(A,z), push-
ing towards more rest unemployment. An increase in g, decreases the gains of wait-
ing because it decreases the probability of experiencing a z-shock without paying c
and hence increases the value of sampling a good z-productivity. In the proof of
220
----------------------------------------

[Page 222 of 269]
Lemma 1 we further show that an increase in WU(A,zs(A)) R(A)leads to an in-
crease in zs(A) zr(A). This implies that for a sufﬁciently large c,bor 1 grest
unemployment arises.
Rest Unemployment and Occupational Human Capital Occupational human
capital accumulation makes a worker more productive in his current occupation.
This implies that workers are willing to stay longer unemployed in their occupa-
tions because, for a given z, they can ﬁnd jobs faster and receive higher wages. At
the same time, a higher xmakes the employed worker less likely to quit into unem-
ployment, generating a force against rest unemployment. Taken together, however,
the ﬁrst effect dominates as the next result shows.
Lemma 2. Consider a setting where A is ﬁxed, z redrawn with probability (1 g), and
production is given by y =Axz. Consider an unexpected, one-time, permanent increase in
occupation-speciﬁc human capital, x, from x =1. Then
d(WU(A,zs(A,x),x) R(A))
dx>0.
This result implies that the difference zs(A,x) zr(A,x)becomes larger when
human capital increases. Thus, more occupational human capital leads to rest un-
employment.
C.1.2 The Cyclicality of Occupational Mobility and Job Separation
Decisions
In Section 2.5 of the main text we documented that occupational mobility through
unemployment (non-employment) is procyclical, while it is well established that job
separations into unemployment (non-employment) are countercyclical (see Section
5 in the main text). In the model, the cyclicalities of workers’ occupational mobility
and job separation decisions are characterised by the slopes of the cutoff functions zr
and zswith respect to A. As discussed in Section 3.3 of the main text, occupational
mobility decisions are procyclical and job separation decisions are countercyclical
when dzr/dA>0 and dzs/dA<0, respectively. We now explore the conditions
under which such slopes arise endogenously in our model.
221
----------------------------------------

[Page 223 of 269]
Occupational Mobility Decisions We start by investigating the impact of rest
unemployment on the slope of zrusing the simpliﬁed version of the model (i.e. xh=
1 for all hand po=1 for all o). Using (10) and noting that R(A) WU(A,zr(A)) = 0,
we obtain

l(q(A,zr))(WE(A,zr) WU(A,zr)) .
(12)
Since workers who decided to search across occupations must sit out one period
unemployed, the term
l(q(A,zr))(WE(A,zr) WU(A,zr))
captures the expected loss associated with the time cost of this decision: by deciding
not to search across occupations, the worker could match with vacancies this period.
When zr>zs,l(q(A,zr))(WE(A,zr) WU(A,zr))>0 and is increasing in Aand
zr. Therefore, an increase in Ain this case, increases the loss associated with the
time cost of searching across occupations and decreases dzr/dA. However, when
rest unemployment occurs ( zs>zr),l(q(A,zr))(WE(A,zr) WU(A,zr)) = 0 and
this effect disappears. This follows as during rest unemployment periods workers
have a contemporaneous job ﬁnding rate of zero and hence by searching across oc-
cupations, the worker does not lose out on the possibility of matching this period.
In this case, the cyclicality of occupational mobility decisions purely depends on the
remaining terms, in particularRz

dF(z). Thus, the presence
of rest unemployment adds a procyclical force to occupational mobility decisions.
Now consider the impact of search frictions on the slope of zr. We focus on the
more general case of zr>zs, which includes the additional countercyclical force
discussed above. To gain analytical tractability we consider the stationary environ-
ment used in the previous subsection and set g=1 such that both Aand workers’
z-productivities are permanent. This allows us to link wages and labor tightness to
y(A,z)in closed form. We then analyse the effects of a one-time, unexpected, and
permanent change in Aonzr.103To isolate the role of search frictions, we compare
103This approach follows Shimer (2005), Mortensen and Nagypal (2007), and Hagedorn and
Manovskii (2008). Since the equilibrium value and policy functions only depend on Aand z,
analysing the change in the expected value of unemployment and joint value of the match after a
one-time productivity shock is equivalent to compare those values at the steady states associated

this case with one without search frictions in which workers (who are currently not
changing occupations) can match instantaneously with ﬁrms and are paid y(A,z).
In both cases we keep in place the same reallocation frictions. Let zr
cdenote the
reallocation cutoff in the case without search frictions. The details of both cases,
including the corresponding value functions and the proof of the following lemma
can be found in Section C.4 of this appendix.

tion time. The proof of Lemma 3 shows that Cs(A,z)/Cs(A,zr)is increasing in zand

c. Thus, the presence of search frictions also adds procyclicality
to the decision to search across occupations. Search frictions lead to a steeper real-
location cutoff function because, in this case, an increase in Aincreases WU(A,z)
through both the wage and the job ﬁnding probability. In contrast, an increase in A
in the frictionless case only affects WU(A,z)through wages (with a proportionally
smaller effect on w b), as workers always ﬁnd jobs with probability one. The fact
that Cs(A,z)/Cs(A,zr)is increasing in zforz>zr, reﬂects that the impact of y(A,z)
onWU(A,z)is increasing in z. Indeed, from the proof of Lemma 3 one obtains

¶A=Cs(A,z)yA(A,z)

One can get further intuition by considering the planners’ problem (for details
see Carrillo-Tudela and Visschers, 2013). The envelope condition implies that the
planner, at the optimum allocation, does not need to change labor market tightness
with each productivity level. This is because in our model the value and policy functions jump
immediately to their steady state level, while the distribution of unemployed and employed over
occupations takes time to adjust.
223
----------------------------------------

[Page 225 of 269]
at each zfor a inﬁnitesimal change in Ato still obtain the maximum net increase in
expected output. At a given z, this means that an increase of dAcreates
dWU(A,z) =bl(q(A,z))
(1 b)(1 b+bl(q(A,z)))yA(A,z)dA=Cs(A,z)yA(A,z)dA
in additional life-time expected discounted output for the planner. Since our econ-
omy is constrained efﬁcient, the change in Aalso creates the same lifetime expected
discounted income for an unemployed worker with such z.
In addition, (13) and (14) show that the cyclicality of zrin either case depends
on the production function y(A,z), in particular on the sign of yA(A,z) yA(A,zr)
forz>zr. In the proof of Lemma 3 we show that with search frictions, the deci-
sions to search across occupations will already be procyclical when the production
function is modular and zris sufﬁciently close to zs. This follows because the op-
portunity cost of searching across occupations becomes smaller as zrapproaches zs
from above. With rest unemployment this opportunity cost is zero. If zris sub-
stantially above zs, we will need sufﬁcient complementarities between Aand zin
the production function to obtain a procyclical zr. Without search frictions, in con-
trast, a supermodular production function is only a necessary condition to generate
procyclicality in zr.
Job Separations The main aspect of having endogenous job separation and
occupational mobility decisions is that the two can potentially interact. In particular,
ifzr>zs, workers separate endogenously to search across occupations and this
could lead to zrand zshaving the same cyclical behavior. For example, in the setting
of Lemma 3 were both Aand workers’ z-productivities are permanent, we show at
the end of Section C.3.2 of this appendix that dzs/dAdepends directly on dzr/dA.
Namely,
dzs(A)
dA= yA(A,zs(A))
yz(A,zs(A))+bl(q(A,zr(A)))
1 b(1 d) +bl(q(A,zr(A)))yA(A,zr(A))
yz(A,zs(A))
1+yz(A,zr(A))
yA(A,zr(A))dzr(A)
dA
.
The second term makes explicit the interaction between the decisions to separate
from a job and to search across occupations when there is no rest unemployment.
It captures the change in the gains of search across occupations, dR(A)/dA, and
shows that zrand zscan have the same cyclicality. When instead zs>zr, workers
endogenously separate into a period of rest unemployment. In this case, R(A)has
224
----------------------------------------

[Page 226 of 269]
a smaller impact on the value of unemployment at the moment of separation. This
is because searching across occupations would only occur further in the future, and
then only if a worker’s z-productivity would deteriorate below zr. Thus, the pres-
ence of rest unemployment weakens any feedback of a procyclical zronto zs. Indeed,
by setting l(.) =0 in the above expression we get that zsis always countercyclical.
C.2 Worker Flows
In a BRE the evolution of the distribution Gof employed and unemployed work-
ers across labor markets (z,x), occupations oand employment status esis a result
of (i) optimal vacancy posting q(.), job separation decisions d(.)and occupational
mobility decisions r(.)andS(.), all depending on the state vector w= (A,p,z,x,o);
and (ii) the exogenous retiring probability m. To obtain the laws of motions of unem-
ployed and employed workers it is then useful to derive the measure of unemployed
and employed workers at each stage jwithin a period, where j=s,r,m,prepresent
separations, reallocations, search and matching and production as described in the
main text. It is also useful to consider the following Markov Chain: in period t
an employed worker with human capital level xhincreases his human capital to
xh+1with probability ce(xh+1jxh), where ce(xh+1jxh) = 1 ce(xhjxh),xh<xh+1,
h=1, . . . , Hand xH<¥. Human capital depreciation occurs during unemploy-
ment with probability cu(xh 1jxh), where cu(xh 1jxh) = 1 cu(xhjxh),xh>xh 1,
h=1, . . . , H. Let uj
t(z,xh,o)denote the measure of unemployed workers in labor
market (z,xh)in occupation oat the beginning of stage jin period t. Similarly, let
ej
t(z,xh,o)denote the measure of employed workers in labor market (z,xh)in occu-
pations oat the beginning of stage jin period t.
C.2.1 Unemployed Workers
Given the initial conditions (A0,p0,Gp

acterised by (z,xh)in occupation oat the beginning of next period’s separation stage

Conditional on not retiring from the labor market, the terms inside the ﬁrst squared
bracket show the probability that unemployed workers in labor markets (˜z,xh,o)
and(˜z,xh+1,o)in the previous period’s production stage will be in labor market
(z,xh,o)immediately after the zand xhshocks occur. The term in the second squared
bracket refers to the measure of new workers who entered the economy to replace
those who left at the beginning of the period due to the m-shock. We assume that
the population of workers is constant over time, making the inﬂow equal to the out-
ﬂow of workers. New workers are assumed to enter unemployed with a ˜zrandomly
drawn from F(.)and with the lowest human capital level x1. The above equation
considers the inﬂow who has been assigned productivity zand occupation o, where
yodenotes the probability that workers in the inﬂow are assigned occupation oand
1h=1denotes an indicator function which takes the value of one when the labor
market (z,xh)is associated with x1and zero otherwise.
During the separation stage some employed workers will become unemployed.
Since by assumption these newly unemployed workers do not participate in the cur-
rent period’s reallocation or search and matching stages, it is convenient to count
them at the production stage. This implies that us
t+1(z,xh,o)dz=ur
t+1(z,xh,o)dz.
Similarly, we will count at the production stage those unemployed workers who
arrived from other occupations during the reallocation stage, as they also do not
participate in the current period’s search and matching stage. This implies that the

C.2.2 Employed Workers

(˜z,xh 1,o)in the previous period’s production stage will be in labor market (z,xh,o)
immediately after the zand xhshocks occur. In this case, the indicator function 1h>1
takes the value of one when the labor market (z,xh)is associated with a value of
xh>x1and zero otherwise.
Since we count those employed workers who separated from their employers in
the production stage and employed workers do not participate in the reallocation or
the search and matching stages, it follows that es

C.3 Competitive Search Model
In the model described in the main text we exogenously segment an occupation into
many sub-markets, one for each pair (z,x). We assumed that workers with current
productivities (z,x)in occupation oonly participate in the sub-market (z,x)in such
an occupation. We now show that this sub-market structure endogenously arises
from a competitive search model in the spirit of Moen (1997) and Menzio and Shi
(2010). To show this property in the simplest way, we focus on the case in which all
occupations have the same productivities (only excess mobility) and workers only
differ in their z-productivities within an occupation. This is the same simpliﬁcation
we used in Section C.1 of this appendix. Adding differences in occupation pro-
ductivities and occupational human capital is a straightforward extension. The full
theoretical and quantitative analysis of this competitive search model can be found
in our earlier working paper Carrillo-Tudela and Visschers (2013).
C.3.1 Basic Setup
As in the main text, we look for an equilibrium in which the value functions and
decisions of workers and ﬁrms in any occupation only depend on the productivities
w= (A,z)and workers’ employment status. Following Menzio and Shi (2010)
and Menzio, Telyukova and Visschers (2016) we divide the analysis in two steps.
The ﬁrst step shows that at most one sub-market is active for workers with current
productivity z. The second step shows that in equilibrium ﬁrms will post wage
contracts such that a worker with current productivity zdoes not ﬁnd it optimal
to visit any other sub-market other than the one opened to target workers of this
productivity.
Assume that in each occupation ﬁrms post wage contracts to which they are
committed. For each value of zin an occupation othere is a continuum of sub-
markets, one for each expected lifetime value ˜Wthat could potentially be offered by
a vacant ﬁrm. After ﬁrms have posted a contract in the sub-market of their choice,
unemployed workers with productivity z(henceforth type zworkers) can choose
which appropriate sub-market to visit. Once type zworkers visit their preferred
sub-market j, workers and ﬁrms meet according to a constant returns to scale match-
228
----------------------------------------

[Page 230 of 269]
ing function m(uj,vj), where ujis the measure of workers searching in sub-market
j, and vjthe measure of ﬁrms which have posted a contract in this sub-market.
From the above matching function one can easily derived the workers’ job ﬁnding
ratel(qj) = m(qj)and the vacancy ﬁlling rate q(qj) = m(1/qj), where labor mar-
ket tightness is given by qj=vj/uj. The matching function and the job ﬁnding and
vacancy ﬁlling rates are assumed to have the following properties: (i) they are twice-
differentiable functions, (ii) non-negative on the relevant domain, (iii) m(0, 0) = 0,
(iv)q(q)is strictly decreasing, and (v) l(q)is strictly increasing and concave.
We impose two restrictions on beliefs off-the-equilibrium path. Workers believe
that, if they go to a sub-market that is inactive on the equilibrium path, ﬁrms will
show up in such measure to have zero proﬁt in expectation. Firms believe that, if
they post in an inactive sub-market, a measure of workers will show up, to make
the measure of deviating ﬁrms indifferent between entering or not. We assume,
for convenience, that the zero-proﬁt condition also holds for deviations of a single
agent: loosely, the number of vacancies or unemployed, and therefore the tightness
will be believed to adjust to make the zero-proﬁt equation hold.
C.3.2 Agents’ Problem
Workers Consider the value function of an unemployed worker having pro-
ductivity zin occupation oat the beginning of the production stage, WU(w) =
b+bE[WR(w0)]. The value of unemployment consists of the ﬂow beneﬁt of unem-
ployment bthis period, plus the discounted expected value of being unemployed at
the beginning of next period’s reallocation stage,
WR(w0) =max
r(w0)fr(w0)R(w0) + ( 1 r(w0))E[S(w0) +WU(w0)]g, (19)
where r(w0)takes the value of one when the worker decides to reallocate and take
the value of zero otherwise and recall Ris the expected value of reallocation. In this
case,
R(w) = c+å
o06=oZ
WU(A0,˜z)dF(˜z)
O 1.
The worker’s expected value of staying and searching in his current occupation is
given by E[S(w0) +WU(w0)]. In this case, WU(w0) =E[WU(w0)]describes the
229
----------------------------------------

[Page 231 of 269]
expected value of not ﬁnding a job, while S(w0)summarizes the expected value
added of ﬁnding a new job. The reallocation decision is captured by the choice
between R(w0)and the expected payoff of search in the current occupation.
To derive S(.)note that l(q(w,Wf))denotes the probability with which a type
zworker meets a ﬁrm fin the sub-market associated with the promised value Wf
and tightness q(w). Further, let a(Wf)denote the probability of visiting such a sub-
market. From the set Wof promised values which are offered in equilibrium by
ﬁrms for a given z, workers only visit with positive probability those sub-markets
for which the associated Wfsatisﬁes
Wf2arg max
Wl(q(w0,Wf))(Wf WU(w0))S(w0). (20)
When the setWis empty, the expected value added of ﬁnding a job is zero and the
worker is indifferent between visiting any sub-market.
Now consider the value function at the beginning of the production stage of an
employed worker with productivity zin a contract that currently has a value ˜Wf(w).
Similar arguments as before imply that
˜Wf(w) =wf+bE
max
d(w0)f(1 d(w0))˜Wf(w0) +d(w0)WU(w0)g
, (21)
where d(w0)take the value of dwhen ˜Wf(w0)WU(w0)and the value of one other-
wise. In equation (21), the wage payment wfat ﬁrm fis contingent on state w, while
the second term describes the worker’s option to quit into unemployment in the
separation stage the next period. Note that WU(w0) =E[WU(w0)]as a worker who
separates must stay unemployed for the rest of the period and ˜Wf(w0) =E[˜Wf(w0)]
as the match will be preserved after the separation stage.
Firms Consider a ﬁrm fin occupation o, currently employing a worker with
productivity zwho has been promised a value ˜Wf(w)WU(w). Noting that the
state space for this ﬁrm is the same as for the worker and given by w, the expected
lifetime discounted proﬁt of the ﬁrm can be described recursively as
J(w;˜Wf(w)) = max
wf,˜Wf(w0)
y(A,z) wf+bEh
max
s(w0)n
(1 s(w0))J(w0;˜Wf(w0)) +s(w0)˜V(w0)oi
,(22)
where s(w0)takes the value of dwhen J(w0;˜Wf(w0))˜V(w0)and the value of one
otherwise, ˜V(w0) = max
V(w0), 0	
and V(w0)denotes the maximum value of an
230
----------------------------------------

[Page 232 of 269]
unﬁlled vacancy in occupation oat the beginning of next period. Hence (22) takes
into account that the ﬁrm could decide to target its vacancy to workers of with a
different productivity in the same occupation or withdraw the vacancy from the
economy and obtain zero proﬁts.
The ﬁrst maximisation in (22) is over the wage payment wfand the promised
lifetime utility to the worker ˜Wf(w0). The second maximisation refers to the ﬁrm’s
layoff decision. The solution to (22) then gives the wage payments during the match
(for each realisation of wfor all t). In turn these wages determine the expected
lifetime proﬁts at any moment during the relation, and importantly also at the start
of the relationship, where the promised value to the worker is ˜Wf.
Equation (22) is subject to the restriction that the wage paid today and tomor-
row’s promised values have to add up to today’s promised value ˜Wf(w), according
to equation (21). Moreover, the workers’ option to quit into unemployment, and the
ﬁrm’s option to lay off the worker imply the following participation constraints

J(w0;˜Wf(w0)) ˜V(w0)
0 and
˜Wf(w0) WU(w0)
0. (23)
Now consider a ﬁrm posting a vacancy in occupation o. Given cost kand know-
ingw, a ﬁrm must choose which unemployed workers to target. In particular, for
each za ﬁrm has to decide which ˜Wfto post given the associated job ﬁlling probabil-
ity,q(q(w,˜Wf)). This probability summarises the pricing behaviour of other ﬁrms
and the visiting strategies of workers. Along the same lines as above, the expected
value of a vacancy targeting workers of productivity zsolves the Bellman equation
V(w) = k+max
˜Wfn
q(q(w,˜Wf))J(w,˜Wf) + ( 1 q(q(w,˜Wf)))˜V(w)o
. (24)
We assume that there is free entry of ﬁrms posting vacancies within any occupa-
tion. This implies that V(w) = 0 and ˜Wfthat yield a q(w,˜Wf)>0, and V(w)0
for all those wand ˜Wfthat yield a q(w,˜Wf)0. In the former case, the free entry
condition then simpliﬁes (24) to k=max ˜Wfq(q(w,˜Wf))J(w,˜Wf).
C.3.3 Endogenous Market Segmentation
We now show that if there are positive gains to form a productive match with a
worker of type z, ﬁrms offer a unique ˜Wfwith associate tightness ˜q(A,z)in the
231
----------------------------------------

[Page 233 of 269]
matching stage. This implies that only one sub-market opens for a given value of
zand workers of productivity zoptimally chose to search in such a sub-market.
Consider a value of z. For any promised value WE, the joint value of the match
is deﬁned as WE+J(A,z,WE)˜M(A,z,WE). Lemma 4 shows that under risk
neutrality the value of a job match is constant in WEand Jdecreases one-to-one
with WE.
Lemma 4. The joint value ˜M(A,z,WE)is constant in WEWU(A,z)and hence we
can uniquely deﬁne M (A,z)de f=˜M(A,z,WE),8M(A,z)WEWU(A,z)on this
domain. Further, J W(A,z,WE) = 1,8M(A,z)>WE>WU(A,z).
The proof of Lemma 4 is presented in Section C.4.4. It crucially relies on the
ﬁrms’ ability to offer workers inter-temporal wage transfers such that the value of
the job match is not affected by the (initial) promised value. Note that Lemma 4
implies that no ﬁrm will post vacancies for zvalues such that M(A,z) WU(A,z)
0. Lemma 5 now shows that for a given z, for which M(A,z) WU(A,z)>0, ﬁrms
offer a unique ˜Wfin the matching stage and there is a unique qassociated with it.
Lemma 5. If the elasticity of the vacancy ﬁlling rate is weakly negative in q, there exists a
unique q(A,z)and W(A,z)that solve (20), subject to (24).
The proof of Lemma 5 is also presented in Section C.4.4. The requirement that
the elasticity of the job ﬁlling rate with respect to qis non-positive is automatically
satisﬁed when q(q)is log concave, as is the case with the Cobb-Douglas and urn
ball matching functions. Both matching functions imply that the job ﬁnding and
vacancy ﬁlling rates have the properties described in Lemma 5 and hence guarantee
a unique pair ˜Wf,q. Consider a Cobb-Douglas matching function as it implies a
constant #q,q(q). Using hto denote the (constant) elasticity of the job ﬁnding rate
with respect to q, we ﬁnd the well-known division of the surplus according to the
Hosios’ (1991) rule
h(WE WU(A,z)) (1 h)J(A,z,WE) =0. (25)
Since for every value of zthere is at most one ˜Wfoffered in the matching stage,
the visiting strategy of an unemployed worker is to visit the sub-market associated
with ˜Wfwith probability one when S(A,z)>0 and to randomly visit any sub-
232
----------------------------------------

[Page 234 of 269]
market when S(A,z) = 0 (or not visit any submarket at all). Let ˜Wz
fdenote the
unique expected value offered to workers of productivity zin equilibrium.
The ﬁnal step is to verify that if we allow ﬁrms to post a menu of contracts which
specify for each za different expected value, then the above equilibrium allocation
and payoffs can be sustained in this more general setting. To show this we closely
follow Menzio and Shi (2010) with the addition of endogenous reallocation. Since
the expected value of reallocation Ris a constant across z-productivities, it is easy
to verify that the proof developed in Menzio and Shi (2010) applies here as well.
Intuitively, consider a BRE in which ﬁrms that want to only attract a worker of
type zoffer a contract with expected value ˜Wz
f, as derived above, to any worker of
type zor higher; and for lower worker types, the ﬁrm offers contracts with expected
values strictly below these types’ value of unemployment. Since ˜Wz
fandqzin this
candidate equilibrium are increasing in z, this implies that only the type zworkers
visit these ﬁrms. To show that this is indeed optimal for ﬁrms, ﬁrst consider the
deviation in which a ﬁrm opens a new sub-market that attracts workers of different
types zand ˆzby offering expected values Wzand Wˆz. Without loss of generality
assume that ﬁrms obtain higher proﬁt from matching with a worker of type zinstead
of type ˆz. Next consider an alternative deviation in which a ﬁrm opens a sub-market
that only attract workers of type zby offering Wzand the value of unemployment
to any other worker type. Given the off-equilibrium beliefs, a higher tightness is
associated with this alternative deviation which makes it more attractive for type
zworkers to visit relative to the original deviation. That is, if there is a strictly
proﬁtable deviation in which more than one type visits the same sub-market, there
is always another strictly more proﬁtable deviation in which a sub-market is visited
by only one type. However, Lemma 5 shows that the latter deviation cannot exist
and therefore there also cannot be a proﬁtable deviation in which more than type
visits the same sub-market in equilibrium.

C.4.1 Proof of Proposition 2
We divide the proof into two parts. In the ﬁrst part we show existence of equilibrium
by deriving the operator T, showing it is a contraction and then verifying that the
candidate equilibrium functions from the ﬁxed point of Tsatisfy all equilibrium
conditions. The second part shows efﬁciency of equilibrium.
C.4.1.1 Existence
Step 1: LetM(w)WE(w) +J(w)denote the value of the match. We want to
show that the value functions M(w),WU(w)and R(w)exist. This leads to a three

the value function G(w,n)forn=0, 1, 2 into the same functional space, such that

Lemma A.1: Tis (i) a well-deﬁned operator mapping functions from the closed
space of bounded continuous functions EintoE, and (ii) a contraction.
First we show that the operator Tmaps bounded continuous functions into
bounded continuous functions. Let WU(w),R(w)and M(w)be bounded contin-
uous functions. It then follows that l(q(w))and D(w)are continuous functions. It
also follows that max fM(w),WU(w)gand maxfR(w),D(w) +WU(w)gare contin-
uous. Further, since the constraint set for Sis compact-valued and does not depend
onw, functions a(.)are continuous, and the integral of continuous function WUis
continuous, the theorem of the maximum then implies that the expression

(27)
is continuous. Therefore Tmaps continuous functions into continuous functions.
Moreover, since the domain of wis bounded, and a(.)andl(.)are bounded on
bounded domains, Tmaps the space of bounded continuous functions into itself.
Second we show that Tdeﬁnes a contraction. Consider two functions G,G02E,
such thatkG G0ksup<#. It then follows that kWU WU0ksup<#,kR R0ksup<#

Step 2 (Linking the Mapping Tand BRE Objects): From the ﬁxed point func-
tions M(w),WU(w)and R(w)deﬁne the function J(w) = maxf(1 z)[M(w) 
WU(w)], 0g, and the functions q(w)and V(w)from 0 =V(w) = k+q(q(w))J(w).
Also deﬁne WE(w) = M(w) J(w)ifM(w)>WU(w), and WE(w) = M(w)if
M(w)WU(w). Finally, deﬁne d(w) = dT(w),s(w) =sT(w),r(w) =rT(w),
S(w) =ST(w)and a w(w)derived using the Nash bargaining equation in the main
text given all other functions.
Given 1 z=hand provided that the job separation decisions between workers
and ﬁrms coincide, which they are as a match is broken up if and only if it is bilater-
ally efﬁcient to do so according to M(w)and WU(w), then equations (5) and (6) in
the main text (describing J(w)and surplus sharing) are satisﬁed. Further, equation
(3) in the main text (describing WE(w)) is satisﬁed by construction, q(w)satisﬁes
the free-entry condition and w(w)satisﬁes equation (6) in the main text. Hence, the
constructed value functions and decision rules satisfy all conditions of the equilib-
rium and the implied evolution of the distribution of employed and unemployed
workers also satisﬁes the equilibrium conditions.
Uniqueness follows from the same procedure in the opposite direction and using
a contradiction argument. Suppose the BRE is not unique. Then a second set of func-
tions exists that satisfy all the equilibrium conditions. Construct ˆM,ˆWUand ˆRfrom
these conditions. Since in any equilibrium the job separation decisions have to be
bilaterally efﬁcient and the occupational mobility decisions ( randS) are captured
inT, then ˆM,ˆWUand ˆRmust be a ﬁxed point of T, contradicting the uniqueness

of the ﬁxed point established by Banach’s Fixed Point Theorem. Hence, there is a
unique BRE.
C.4.1.2 Efﬁciency
The social planner, currently in the production stage, solves the problem of maxi-
mizing total discounted output by choosing job separations decisions d(.), occupa-
tional mobility decisions r(.)andS(.), as well as vacancy creation decisions v(.)for
each pair (z,xh)across all occupations o2Oin any period t. The ﬁrst key aspect of
the planner’s choices is that they could potentially depend on the entire state space
Wj=fz,x,o,A,p,Gjgfor each of the four within period stages j=s,r,m,p(sep-
aration, reallocation, search and matching, production) and workers’ employment
status, such that its maximization problem is given by

subject to the initial conditions (A0,p0,Gp
0), the laws of motion for unemployed and
employed workers described in Section C.2 of this appendix (with corresponding
state space Wjfor the decision rules), and the choice variables r(.)and d(.)being
continuous variables in [0, 1], as the planner can decide on the proportion of workers
in labor market (z,xh)to separate from their jobs or to change occupations.
Note that implicitly the social planner is constrained in the search technology
across occupations: it faces the same restrictions as an individual worker (in oc-
cupation o2O), on the proportion of time that can be devoted to obtain a z-
productivity from occupation ˜o6=o. Namely, s˜o(.)2[0, 1],å˜o2O os˜o(.) = 1 and
å˜o2O oa(s˜o(.),o)1, where O 
odenotes the set of remaining occupations relative
too. The latter notation highlights that, as in the decentralised problem, once the
occupational mobility decision has been taken the new z-productivity cannot be ob-
tain from the departing occupation.

In Section C.2 of this appendix, we decomposed the next period’s measure of
unemployed workers at the production stage, up0, into three additive terms (see
equation (16)). The ﬁrst term refers to those unemployed workers that were unsuc-
cessful in matching, either due to not ﬁnding a posted vacancy in their submarket
or because the planner chose not to post vacancies in their submarket. The second
term refers to those workers who separated from employment and hence were re-
stricted from the search and matching stage within the period. The third term refers
to those who changed occupations and came from other markets into submarket
(z,xh,o)and were restricted from the search and matching stage within the period.
Likewise, we decomposed the next period’s measure of employed workers at the
production stage into two additive terms (see equation (18)). The ﬁrst one refers to
the survivors in employment from the previous separation stage, while the second
terms refers to new hires. Given a continuation value function WSP(Wp0)that is lin-
ear inGp, as in (33), we now show that we can also decompose the expression in (32)
into different additive components.
Consider ﬁrst those unemployed workers who are eligible to participate in the
search and matching stage. Note that the matching technology implies v(Wm) =
239
----------------------------------------

[Page 241 of 269]
q(Wm)(1 r(Wr))um(z,xh,o). Therefore we can consider q(Wm0)as the planner’s
choice in equation (32) instead of v(Wm0). Next we isolate the terms of WSP(Wp0)
that involve workers who went through the search and matching stage: the ﬁrst
term of the unemployed worker ﬂow equation (16) and the second term of the em-
ployed worker ﬂow equation (18). We then combine these terms with the cost of va-
cancy posting in (32). Noting that the dependence of um(Wm0)captures a potential
dependence of the planner’s occupational mobility decisions made in the previous
reallocation stage, we can express the terms in the mapping (32) that involve q(Wm0)
as

h=1Zz

(34)
Note that by backwards induction, the planner’s optimal decisions for q(Wm0)max-
imize (34). Given that the terms within the curly brackets only depend on w0when
the continuation value is linear as in (33), maximizing with respect to qimplies an
optimal q(w0). Using this result we let Wm,SP(w0)denote the sum of the maximized
terms inside the curly brackets in (34) .
Next consider the search-direction choice across occupations for those workers
who the planner has decided to move across occupations. The following expression
summarizes the terms of (32) that involve this choice,

where we have applied the properties of the z-productivity process to change the or-
der of integration relative to the third term of ﬂow equation (16) and have integrated
over all of next period’s production stage states. Since we allow previous decisions
to depend on the entire state space, ur
t+1(.)andr(.)are written as a function of Wr0as
they potentially depend on the distribution Gr. Note, however, that the term inside
the curly brackets in (35) can be maximized separately for each (z0,xh0,o0)and can
therefore be summarized by Rgross ,SP(w0) = RSP(w0) c, while the search intensity
decisionS(.)has solution vector fs(w0,˜o)g.

Hence we have established that the mapping TSPdescribed in equation (32) maps
functions WSP(.)from the space of functions linear with respect to the distribution

It is now straightforward to show that if TWU,SP

tion mappings, then (37) (and thereby (32)) is also a contraction mapping. Given the
regularity properties assumed on the shock processes and following the proof of the
241
----------------------------------------

[Page 243 of 269]
decentralised case in Section C.4.1.1 of this appendix, we can show that a ﬁxed point
exists for (38) and (39). Using equation (37), we then can construct the ﬁxed point of
the expression in (32). It then follows from (38) and (39) that if the Hosios’ condition
holds, allocations of the ﬁxed point of Tare allocations of the ﬁxed point of TSP, and
hence the equilibrium allocations in the decentralised setting are also the efﬁcient
allocations.
C.4.1.3 BRE gives the unique equilibrium allocation
We now show that in any equilibrium, decisions and value functions only depend
onw= (z,xh,o,A,p). We proceed using a contradiction argument. Suppose there
is an alternative equilibrium in which values and decisions do not depend only
onw, but also on an additional factor like the entire distribution of workers over
employment status and z-productivitiesG, or its entire history of observables, Ht.
Consider the associated value functions in this alternative equilibrium, where the
relevant state vector of the alternative equilibrium is given by (w,Ht). Our aim is to
show that such an equilibrium cannot exist.
First suppose that in the alternative equilibrium all value functions are the same
as in the BRE, but decisions differ at the same w. This violates the property that,
in our setting, all maximizers in the BRE value functions are unique, leading to a
contradiction. Now suppose that in the alternative equilibrium at least one value
function differs from the corresponding BRE value function at the same w. It is
straightforward to show that the expected values of unemployment must differ in
both equilibria. Let WU(w,Ht)denote the value function for unemployed workers
in the alternative equilibrium, and let WU(w)denote the corresponding value func-
tion in the BRE for the same w. Since in the proof of efﬁciency of a BRE we did not
rely on the uniqueness of the BRE in the broader set of all equilibria, we can use the
proved results of Section C.3.1.2 of this appendix here.
In particular, recall that the social planner’s problem is entirely linear in the dis-
tribution of workers across states and hence WU(w)is the best the unemployed
worker with wcan do (without transfers), including in the market equilibrium.
Likewise, M(w)is the highest value of the joint value of a match, including in the
market equilibrium. Since value functions are bounded from above and from below
242
----------------------------------------

[Page 244 of 269]
and are continuous in their state variables, there exists a supremum of the difference
between WU(w)and the candidate market equilibrium’s WU(w,Ht), sup(WU(w) 
WU(w,Ht)) = eu>0. Similarly, there also exists a supremum for the difference be-
tween M(w)and M(w,Ht), sup(M(w) M(w,Ht)) = em>0. In what follows, we
will show that a difference in the value functions for unemployed workers (or the
value functions for the joint value of the match) arbitrarily close to eu>0 (orem>0)
cannot occur. Otherwise, this will require that the difference in tomorrow’s values to
be larger than eu(orem). In turn, this implies that an alternative equilibrium cannot
exist.
From the above deﬁnition of supremum, it follows that
maxfM(w),WU(w)g maxfM(w,Ht),WU(w,Ht)g<maxfeu,emg.
Since
M(w) =y(z,xh,A,po) +bE[maxfM(w0),WU(w0)g],
and likewise for M(w,Ht)it follows that at any (w,Ht),
M(w) M(w,Ht))<bmaxfeu,emg. (40)
Consider ﬁrst the case in which emeu. For (w,Ht)achieving a difference M(w) 
M(w,Ht)>bemis not possible since this will lead to a contradiction in equation
(40) when em>0.
Next consider the case in which em<eu. Simplifying notation by dropping w
and using the prime instead of (w,Ht), we ﬁrst establish an intermediate step. At
any(w,Ht)it holds that
l(q)(1 h)M+ (1 l(q)(1 h))W<l(q0)(1 h)M0+ (1 l(q0)(1 h))W0+eu.
(41)
There are two cases to be analysed to show the above relationship.
Case 1: Suppose that (M0 W0)M W, then l(q0)l(q). Deﬁne K= (1 
h)(l(q0) l(q))(M0 W0)0. Combining the latter with l(q)(1 h)(M M0) +
(1 l(q)(1 h))(W W0)eu, it must be true that
l(q)(1 h)(M M0) + ( 1 l(q)(1 h))(W W0) Keu, (42)
from which (41) follows.
243
----------------------------------------

[Page 245 of 269]
Case 2: Suppose that (M W)>(M0 W0), then l(q)>l(q0). From the derivative
ofd
d(M W)(l(q(M W))(1 h)(M W)) = l(q(M W)), we can establish that, if
(M W)>(M0 W0),
l(q)((M W) (M0 W0))>l(q)(1 h)(M W) l(q0)(1 h)(M0 W0)>l(q0)((M W) (M0 W0)).
Since in any equilibrium (not only in the BRE) q0depends only on (M0 W0)and
constant parameters, we can use this relationship to establish that
W+l(q)(M W) (W0+l(q)(M0 W0))<eu,
from which (41) follows.
The ﬁnal step is to consider an (w,Ht)such that maxfem,b 1eug<WU(w) 
WU(w,Ht)<eu, where such a (w,Ht)exists by the deﬁnition of supremum. With
this in hand it is straightforward to check that the difference in tomorrow ’s value (un-
der the expectation sign), between WU(w)and WU(w,Ht)will not exceed eu, since
term-by-term, the difference is bounded by eu. This also implies that today’s dif-
ference, WU(w) WU(w,Ht), cannot be more than beu>0, which contradicts our
premise. This establishes that a difference in the value functions for unemployed
workers (or the value functions for the joint value of the match) arbitrarily close to
eu>0 (or em>0) cannot occur. Hence the BRE is the unique equilibrium.
This completes the proof of Proposition 2.
C.4.2 Proof of Existence of a Reallocation and Separation cutoff
C.4.2.1 Reservation property of occupational mobility decisions, zr
Here we show that M(w)and WU(w)as derived in the proof of Proposition 2 are
increasing in z. IfM(w)and WU(w)are continuous and bounded functions increas-
ing in z,Tmaps them into increasing (bounded and continuous) functions. For em-
ployed workers (T(G(w, 0)), this follows since both max fM(w0),WU(w0)gand y(.)
are increasing in z, while the stochastic dominance of the z-productivity transition
law implies higher expected z’s tomorrow. For unemployed workers (T(G(w, 1)),
note that the value of changing occupations R(w)does not depend on the current z
of the worker, while equation (29) implies that D(M(w) WU(w)) + WU(w)is in-
creasing in z. Again, given stochastic dominance of the tomorrow’s zwhen today’s z
244
----------------------------------------

[Page 246 of 269]
is higher, T(G(w, 1))is also increasing in z. The reservation property follows imme-
diately, since R(w)is constant in zand D(M(w) WU(w)) + WU(w)is increasing
inz.
C.4.2.2 Reservation property of job separation decisions, zs
We now show that M(w) WU(w)is increasing in zwhen d+l(q(w))<1 for
the case of no human capital accumulation and occupational-wide shocks. In the
calibration we show that this property holds also for the case of human capital ac-
cumulation and occupational-wide shocks.
Consider the same operator Tdeﬁned in the proof of Proposition 2, but now the
relevant state space is given by (A,z). Note that the value functions describing the
worker’s and the ﬁrm’s problem, do not change, except for the fact that we are using
a smaller state space. It is straightforward to verify that the derived properties of T
in Lemma A.1 also apply in this case. We now want to show that this operator maps
the subspace of functions Ginto itself with M(A,z)increasing weakly faster in zthan
WU(A,z). To show this, take M(A,z)and WU(A,z)such that M(A,z) WU(A,z)
is weakly increasing in zand let zsdenote a reservation productivity such that for
z<zsa ﬁrm-worker match decide to terminate the match. Using l(q)(M WU) 
qk=l(q)(M WU) l0(q)(M WU)q=l(q)(1 h)(M WU), we construct the
following difference
TG(A,z, 0) TG(A,z, 1) = (43)

.
The ﬁrst part of the proof shows the conditions under which TG(A,z, 0) TG(A,z, 1)
is weakly increasing in z. Because the elements of the our relevant domain are re-
stricted to have WU(A,z)increasing in z, and M(A,z) WU(A,z)increasing in z,
we can start to study the value of the term under the expectation sign, by cutting a
number of different cases to consider depending on where z0is relative to the im-
plied reservation cutoffs.
– Case 1. Consider the range of tomorrow’s z02[z(A0),zr(A0)), where zr(A0)<
zs(A0). In this case, the term under the expectation sign in the above equation re-
245
----------------------------------------

[Page 247 of 269]
duces to R
WU(A0,˜z)dF(˜z) +c+WU(A0,z0), which is increasing in z0.
– Case 2. Now suppose tomorrow’s z02[zr(A0),zs(A0)). In this case, the term under
the expectation sign becomes zero (as M(A0,z0) WU(A0,z0) = 0), and is therefore
constant in z0.
– Case 3. Next suppose that z02[zs(A0),zr(A0)). In this case, the entire term under
the expectation sign reduces to
(1 d)(M(A0,z0) WU(A0,z0)) Z
WU(A0,˜z)dF(˜z) +c+WU(A0,z0),
and, once again, is weakly increasing in z0, because by supposition M(A0,z0) 
WU(A0,z0)is weakly increasing in z0, and so is WU(A0,z0)by Lemma A.1.
– Case 4. Finally consider the range of z0maxfzr(A0),zs(A0)g, such that in this
range employed workers do not quit nor reallocate. In this case the term under the
expectation sign equals
(1 d)[M(A0,z0) WU(A0,z0)] l(q(A0,z0))(1 h)[M(A0,z0) WU(A0,z0)]. (44)
It is easy to show using the free entry condition thatd(l(q(A0,z0))(1 h)[M(A0,z0) WU(A0,z0)])
d(M W)=
l(q(A0,z0)), and hence that the derivative of (44) with respect to z0is positive when-
ever 1 d l(q)0.
Given F(z0jz)<F(z0j˜z)for all z,z0when z>˜z, the independence of zofA, and
that the term under the expectation sign are increasing in z0, given any A0, it follows
that the integral in (43) is increasing in today’s z. Together with y(A,z)increasing
inz, it must be that TG(A,z, 1) TG(A,z, 0)is also increasing in z.
To establish that the ﬁxed point also has increasing differences in zbetween the
ﬁrst and second coordinate, we have to show that the space of this functions is
closed in the space of bounded and continuous functions. In particular, consider the
set of functions Fde f=ff2Cj f:XY!R2,jf(x,y, 1) f(x,y, 2)jincreasing in yg,
where f(., ., 1),f(., ., 2)denote the ﬁrst and second coordinate, respectively, and C
the metric space of bounded and continuous functions endowed with the sup-norm.
The next step in the proof is to show that ﬁxed point of TG(A,z, 0) TG(A,z, 1)
is also weakly increasing in z. To show we ﬁrst establish the following result.

f0(x,y, 1) f0(x,y, 2), contradicting the premise.
Thus, the ﬁxed point exhibits this property as well and the optimal quit policy is
a reservation- zpolicy given 1 d l(q)>0. Since y(A,z)is strictly increasing in z,
the ﬁxed point difference M WUmust also be strictly increasing in z. Furthermore,
since l(q)is concave and positively valued, l0(q)(M WU) = kimplies that job
ﬁnding rate is also (weakly) increasing in z.
C.4.3 Proofs of the “Model Implications and Comparative Statics”
We now turn to the proofs of Lemmas 1, 2 and 3 presented in Section C.1. Re-
call that these results were derived using a simpliﬁed version of the model with-
out occupational human capital accumulation, setting xh=1 for all h, and with-
out occupational-wide productivity shocks, setting po=1 for all o. These restric-
tions imply that the relevant state space is (z,A). We further assumed that the z-
productivity is redrawn randomly with probability 0 <(1 g)<1 each period
from cdf F(z)and Ais held constant. In this stationary environment, the expected
value of unemployment for a worker currently with productivity zin occupation o
is given by
WU(A,z) = g
b+bmaxn
R(A),WU(A,z) +maxfl(q(A,z))(1 h)(M(A,z) WU(A,z)), 0go
+ ( 1 g)Ez[WU(A,z)]. (45)
where the expected value of occupational mobility is given by R(A) = c+Ez[WU(A,z)].
The values of employment at wage w(A,z)for a worker currently with productivity
zand a ﬁrm employing this worker are given by
WE(A,z) =g
w(A,z) +b[(1 d)WE(A,z) +dWU(A,z)]+ (1 g)Ez[WE(A,z)],
(46)
J(A,z) =g
y(A,z) w(A,z) +b[(1 d)J(A,z))]+ (1 g)Ez[J(A,z)]. (47)
247
----------------------------------------

[Page 249 of 269]
The joint value of a match is then
M(A,z) =g
y(A,z) +b[(1 d)M(A,z) +dWU(A,z)]+ (1 g)Ez[M(A,z)].
(48)
Proof of Lemma 1 We state the detailed version of this lemma as Lemma H.1.
To simplify the analysis and without loss of generality, in what follows we let d=0.
Since we do not vary aggregate productivity to proof this lemma, we let A=1 and
abusing notation we refer to zas total output. This is done without loss of gen-
erality as now output only depends (and is strictly increasing and continuous) on
the worker-occupation match-speciﬁc productivity. To abbreviate notation deﬁned
WsWU(zs).
Lemma H.1: The differences Ws R and zr zs, respond to changes in c, b and gas
follows
1.(i) Ws R is strictly increasing in c and (ii) zr zsis decreasing in c, strictly if
zr>zs.
2.(i) Ws R is strictly increasing in b and (ii) zr zsis strictly decreasing in b.
3.(i) Ws R is strictly decreasing in gand (ii) zr zsis strictly increasing in g.
We ﬁrst consider the link between Ws Rand zr zsas the parameter of interest
k(i.e. c,borg) changes. The reservation productivities for job separation and
occupational mobility implicitly satisfy
M(k,zs(k)) Ws(k) =0
(49)
WU(k,zr(k)) R(k) =l(q(k,zr(k)))(1 h)(M(k,zr(k)) Ws(k)) + ( Ws(k) R(k)) = 0,
(50)
where (50) only applies when R(k)Ws(k)and hence only when zr(k)zs(k). In
the case of Ws(k)>R(k), the assumed stochastic process for zimplies that zr(k) =
z. The latter follows as WU(z) = Ws(k)for all z<zs. Also note that we can use
Ws(k)instead of W(k,zr(k))in (50) as the assumed stochastic process for zalso
implies that WU(z) =Ws(k)for all z<zrwhen R(k)>Ws(k).
248
----------------------------------------

[Page 250 of 269]
Note that by deﬁning
Z(k)Ez[maxfM(k,z),Ws(k)g maxfWU(k,z)+l(q(k,z))(1 h)(M(k,z) WU(k,z)),R(k)g],
we can rewrite equations (49) and (50) as
M(k,zs(k)) Ws(k) =zs b+b(1 g)Z(k) +bg(Ws(k) R(k)) = 0.
Further note that
M(k,zr(k)) Ws(k) =zr b+b(1 g)Z(k) +bg(1 l(q(k,zr))(1 h))(M(k,zr(k)) Ws(k)),
which is strictly positive and changes with k. Using (50) leads to
(1 bg)(M(k,zr(k)) Ws(k)) = zr b+b(1 g)Z(k) +bg(Ws(k) R(k))
Leaving implicit the dependency on k, we obtain that
d(M Ws)
d(Ws R)=d(M Ws)
d(l(q)(1 h)(M Ws))d(l)(1 h)(M Ws)
d(Ws R),
where the latter term equals  1, and the former term equals l 1(q). This follows
as Nash Bargaining and free-entry imply q(q)h(M WU) =cand hencedq
dM WU=
q
(1 h)(M WU). Then l0(q)dq
dM WU(1 h)(M WU) +l(q)(1 h)reduces to l(q). It
then follows that when zr(k)zs(k), the derivative of zrwith respect to kis given
by

 b+b(1 g)Z(k)

We can similarly obtain that when zr(k)zs(k), the derivative of zswith respect to
kis given by
dzs(k)
dk= d
dk
 b+b(1 g)Z(k)
 bgd(Ws(k) R(k))

Equations (51) and (52) then imply that when zr(k)zs(k)(i.e. zrand zs(k)are
interior), the derivative of zr(k) zs(k)with respect to khas the opposite sign to the
derivative of Ws(k) R(k)with respect to k.
As mentioned above, in the case of Ws(k)>R(k)our simpliﬁed model implies
zr(k) = z. Hence changes in kcan only affect zs, although will affect Ws(k)and
R(k). Using (45) and (48) we obtain that for Ws(k)>R(k)the reservation separation

zs(k) =b 1 g

Taking derivative with respect to kthen lead to

(53)
To complete the lemma we now obtain the derivatives of Ws(k) R(k)and
Ez[M(k,z) WU(k,z)]with respect to k.
Comparative Statics with respect to c:Consider the difference Ws Rand
values of csuch that RWs. In this case we have that
Ws= (1 g)(R+c) +g(b+bR),
Ws R= g(1 b)R+ (1 g)c+gb.
Suppose towards a contradiction that d(Ws R)/dc<0. The above equations im-
ply thatdR
dc>(1 g)
g(1 b)>0. We will proceed by showing that under d(Ws R)/dc<0
both the expected match surplus (after a z-shock) and the match surplus for active
labor markets (those with productivities that entail positive match surplus) decrease
with c, which implies that the value of unemployment decreases with c, which in
turn impliesdR
dc<0, which is our contradiction.
Consider an active labor market with WU(z)>R, the surplus on this labor
market is then given by
M(z) WU(z) =g(z b+b(1 l(q(z))(1 h))(M(z) WU(z)))
+ (1 g)(E[M(z) WU(z)] + ( z E[z])), (54)
where E[M(z) WU(z)]describes the expected surplus after a z-shock (after the
search stage). Note that
d
d(M(z) WU(z))(l(q(z))(1 h)(M(z) WU(z))) = l(q(z)). (55)
As described before, this result follows as (dropping the zargument for brevity) our
assumptions of Nash Bargaining and free-entry imply (1 h)(M WU) =(1 h)
hJ=
1 h

q(q), and hence l(q)(1 h)(M WU) =1 h

that from (54) we obtain
0<d(M(z) WU(z))
d(E[M(z) WU(z)])=1 g
1 gb(1 l(q(z)))<1. (56)
We now show that under d(Ws R)/dc<0, the expected match surplus de-
creases in c. Note that the expected match surplus measured after the search stage
is given by
E[M(z) WU(z)] =Z
zrz b+b(1 l(q(z))(1 h))(M(z) WU(z))dF(z)
+Zzr
zsz b+b(M(z) R)dF(z) +Zzs
z b+b(Ws R)dF(z),
(57)
where the (1 g)shock integrates out. Our contradiction supposition implies that
the third term of this expression is decreasing in c. The second term,Rzr
zs[M(z) 
WU(z)]dF(z), can be rewritten as
M(z) Ws=g(z b+b(M(z) Ws+Ws R)) + ( 1 g)(E[M(z) WU(z)] +z E[z]),
and rearranging yields
M(z) Ws=g
1 gb(z b+b(Ws R)) +1 g
1 gbE[M(z) WU(z)],
whereg
1 gb(z b+b(Ws R))is decreasing in cunder our contradiction suppo-
sition. In the case of the ﬁrst term in (57), note that (56) implies M(z) WU(z)
depends on cthrough E[M(z) WU(z)]. Combining all the elements, (56), (57) and
the last two equations, we ﬁnd that

Next considerdWU(z)

251
----------------------------------------

[Page 253 of 269]
WU(z) = Ws= (1 g)E[WU(z)] +g(b+bE[WU(z)] bc); while for z>zr,
WU(z) = ( 1 g)E[WU(z)] +g(b+b(l(q(z))(1 h)(M(z) WU(z)) +bWU(z))).
It then follows that
E[WU(z)] = F(zr)(b+bE[WU(z)] bc) +Z
zr(b+bl(q(z))(1 h)(M(z) WU(z)) +bWU(z))dF(z),
which combined with
WU=1 g

E[WU(z)]

Taking the derivative with respect to c, we ﬁnd that both the ﬁrst and second terms
on the RHS of the last expression decrease with c, the latter because we have estab-
lished before thatd(M(z) WU(z))
dc<0. It then follows thatdE[WU(z)]
dc<0 and hence
dR
dc=dE[WU(z)]
dc 1<0, which yields our desired contradiction. Equations (51) and
(52) then imply thatd(zr(c) zs(c))
dc<0 when zr>zs.
Now consider the difference Ws Rand values of csuch that R<Ws. In this
case rest unemployment implies Ws=g(b+bWs) + ( 1 g)E[WU(z)]. Note that
heredWs
dc=0, since workers with productivities zzswill never change occupa-
tions. Doing so implies paying a cost c>0 and randomly drawing a new produc-
tivity, while by waiting a worker obtains (with probability 1  g) a free draw from
the productivity distribution. Hence, d(Ws R)/dc= dR/dc. Since workers with
z>zsprefer employment in their current occupation, the above arguments imply
that when R<Wsthe expected value of unemployment, WU(z), is independent of
the value the worker obtains from sampling a new zin a different occupation. It
then follows thatdR
dc=dE[WU(z)]
dc 1= 1<0, which once again yields are desired
contradiction. Further note that in this casedEz[M(c,z) WU(c,z)]
dc=0 and hence (53)
implies thatdzs(c)
dc=0 andd(zr(c) zs(c))
dc=0 when zs>zr.
Comparative Statics with respect to b:We proceed in the same way as in the
previous case. Consider the difference Ws Rsuch that RWs. Expressing Ws

and WU, for z>zs, as
Ws= (1 g)E[WU(z)] +g(b+b(R Ws)) +gbWs(59)
WU(z) = ( 1 g)E[WU(z)] +g(b+b(l(q)(1 h)(M(z) WU(z)))) + gbWU(z),
(60)
we ﬁnd that Ws E[WU(z)] =R
zr(Ws WU(z))dF(z), which in turn implies
Ws R=1

 bgZ

(61)
That is, the difference Ws Rdecomposes into (i) the forgone option of searching
for a job in the new occupation next period (ﬁrst term in the brackets) and (ii) a
sampling cost that only has to be incurred next period with probability g, and dis-
counted at rate b(second term in the brackets).
Next consider the relationship between M(z) WU(z)andE[M(z) WU(z)].
From (55) and (56), we ﬁnd that
d(M(z) WU(z))
db=1 g
1 gb(1 l(q(z)))dE[M(z) WU(z)]

Note thatd(M(z) WU(z))
dbmust have the same sign for all z, which is positive if and
only if

Towards a contradiction, suppose d(Ws R)/db<0. Then, we haved(Ws R)

by (60), it follows thatd(Ws R)
db<0 impliesd(M(z) WU(z))
db>0 and by (62) that
dE[M(z) WU(z)]

where C2and C3are positive constants. The fact that the last expression leads to

imply thatd(zr(b) zs(b))
db<0 when zr>zs.
Next we consider the case in which Ws>Rand note that in this case equation
(61) becomes
Ws E[WU(z)] = bg

zsl(q(z))(1 h)(M(z) WU(z))dF(z).
As before, if we start from the premise that d(Ws R)/db<0, this will imply, by
virtue of (62), thatdE[M(z) WU(z)]
db>0. Noting that in this case equation (57) reduces
to
E[M(z) WU(z)] =Z
zsz b+bl(q(z))(1 h)(M(z) WU(z))dF(z),

Equation (53) then imply thatd(zr(b) zs(b))

as before by assuming (towards a contradiction) that d(Ws R)/dg>0. We start

0 also when zs>zr. This complete the proof for Lemma H.1.
Proof of Lemma 2 Using the same setting as in Lemma H.1 we now introduce
human capital x, assuming it enters in a multiplicative way in the production func-
tion. Keeping the same notation as in Lemma H.1, let A=1 such that total output
is given by zx. Without loss of generality for the results derived in this lemma, nor-
malize x=1. If we have an incremental improvement in xthat is occupational
speciﬁc, the value of sampling will stay constant, at R=E[WU(1,z)] c. However,
the value of Ws(x)will increases with x. Since Ws(x) = ( 1 g)E[WU(x,z)] +g(b+
bmaxfR,Ws(x)g)it follow that Ws(x)is increasing in xthrough E[WU(x,z)].
To investigate the dependence between Ws(x)andE[WU(x,z)]when xchanges
we ﬁrst suppose that RWs(x). The value of unemployment when zzr(x)is
given by
WU(x,z) = ( 1 g)E[WU(x,z)] +g(b+bl(q(x,z)))(1 h)(M(x,z) WU(x,z)) +bWU(x,z)),
while for zr(x)>zit is given by
Ws(x) = ( 1 g)E[WU(x,z)] +g(b+bR).
When comparing the expected value of separating with the expected value of mov-
ing to another occupations (reseting x=1), the difference is given by
Ws(x) E[WU(1,z)] = ( 1 g)E[WU(x,z)] + C4,

----------------------------------------

[Page 259 of 269]
where C4denotes those terms that are constant in x.
As a result,d(Ws(x) E[WU(1,z)])
dx= (1 g)dE[WU(x,z)]
dx, where E[WU(x,z)]can be
expressed as
E[WU(x,z)] = F(zr(x))(b+bR) +Z

Using the expression WU(x,z), it then follows that

Taking the derivative with respect to xand using the envelope condition, which
implies that the term premultiplying dzr(x)/dxequal zero, yields

1 b(1 (1 g)F(zr(x))). (70)
Since the denominator is positive, the sign of dE[WU(x,z)]/dxis given by the sign
of its numerator. By virtue of the envelope condition and equation (55) in the proof
of Lemma 1, the latter is given
Z
zr(x)bl(q(x,z))d(M(x,z) WU(x,z))

Hence the numerator of (70) is given by

It is then clear that the sign of dE[WU(x,z)]/dxis the same as the sign of dE[M(x,z) 

its sign. For this purpose it is useful to note that

The next step is to investigate whether the sum of all terms premultiplyingdE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]
dx
in (75) is less than 1. If this is the case, grouping all these terms and solving for
dE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]/dxwill imply that dE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]/dx>0 as the
reminder terms in the RHS of (75) are positive because the integrating terms z E[z]
will also yield a positive term.
259
----------------------------------------

[Page 261 of 269]
We proceed by noting that the terms premultiplyingdE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]
dxin the last
three lines of (75) are larger than in (74). By replacing the premultiplication term in
(74) with the corresponding term in (75) we will show that the entire term premul-
tiplyingdE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]
dxin (75) is less than one. Some algebra establishes that to
show the latter we need to verify that
bd(M(x,y) WU(x,y))
dx+d(Ws R)
dx
F(zr(x))<1 b(1 g)(1 F(zr(x))).
(76)
By collecting the terms premultiplyingdE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]
dx+z E[z], and substituting
these into the LHS of (76), we obtain that
F(zr)b(1 g)(1 b+b(1 g)F(zr(x)))
(1 gb)(1 b+b(1 g)F(zr(x)))+b(1 g)(b(1 g)(1 F(zr(x))))

=b(1 g)(1 b+b(1 g))
(1 gb)(1 b+b(1 g)F(zr(x)))F(zr(x)). (77)
The RHS of (76) can be rewritten as 1  b+bg+b(1 g)F(zr(x)). Noting that
bg>bg(b(1 g))
1 b+b(1 g)
F(zr(x))
(1 gb)(1 b+b(1 g)F(zr(x)))(78)

1 b+b(1 g)
F(zr(x))
(1 gb)(1 b+bF(zr(x))), (79)
and adding them up we ﬁnd that the RHS is precisely the term in (77). Therefore
bg+b(1 g)F(zr(x))is larger than (77), from which the desired result follows as
the remaining term, 1  b, is larger than zero and the desired inequality is slack. This
yields dE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]/dx>0. It then follows from (71) that d(M(x,z) 
WU(x,z))/dx>0 and therefore, by (70), that dE[WU(x,z)]/dx>0 and d(Ws(x) 
R)/dx>0.
We now need to consider the case in which Ws(x)>R. Here we once again
obtain that
d(Ws(x) R)
dx= (1 g)dE[WU(x,z)]
dx,
where
(1 b)dE[WU(x,z)]

while the expected surplus evolves according to
dE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]
dx=Z
zs(x)z+b(1 l(q(x,z)))d(M(x,z) WU(x,z))
dx. (82)
Substituting (81) into (82), it follows thatdE[M(x,z) WU(x,z)]
dx>0, from which in turn
it follows that (80) is also positive.
Finally, we investigate the implications of a change in xonzs(x)and zr(x). When
zr(x)>zs(x), these reservation cutoff functions are given by
M(x,zs(x)) Ws(x) =0
l(q(x,zr(x)))(1 h)(M(x,zr(x)) WU(x,zr(x))) + ( Ws(x) R) =0.
Further we can obtain that
M(x,zs(x)) Ws(x) =xzs(x) b+b(1 g)E[maxfM(x,z) WU(x,z),Ws(x) Rg]

which implies that, evaluated at x=1,
dzs(x)
dx dzr(x)
dx>zr(x) zs(x).
The above result then yields that for zr>zs, more occupational human capital
brings closer together the two cutoffs. For zr<zs, it holds in this simpliﬁed setting
that zrjumps to the corner, zr=z, while zsdecreases with x. This completes the
proof of Lemma 2.
Proof of Lemma 3 To proof this lemma we use the equations (45) - (48), where
we have assumed no human capital accumulation. Further, to simplify we let g=1
such that the z-productivity does not change. We also focus on the case in which
zr>zssuch that zr,zs2(z,¯z)and without loss of generality let d=0. In this
stationary environment, described by Aand z, note that at labor markets whose
z-productivities equal zrit holds that
Z¯z
zWU(A,z)dF(z) c=WU(A,zr) +l(q(A,zr))(WE(A,zr) WU(A,zr)). (84)
Further, the expected value of unemployment for workers with z<zris given by
WU(A,z) =WU(A,zr). This follows since over this range of z’s,
Z¯z
zWU(A,z)dF(z) cWU(A,z) +l(q(A,z))(WE(A,z) WU(A,z)))
and unemployed workers prefer change occupations the period after arrival. On
the other hand, the value of unemployment for workers with zzris given by
WU(A,z) =b+bl(q(A,z))(WE(A,z) WU(A,z))

Equation (84) can then be expressed as

where the LHS describes the net beneﬁt of moving to a different occupation and the
RHS the beneﬁt of staying in the same occupation. With this derivation we now
analyse under what conditions dzr/dA>0 and compare it to the competitive case.
To obtain the dzr/dAfrom (85) we ﬁrst use the free-entry condition and the
Cobb-Douglas speciﬁcation for the matching function to obtain an implicit function
that solves for q,
q(A,z)h 1h(y(A,z) b) b(1 h)q(A,z)k
1 b kE(q;A,z) =0,
where differentiation then implies that qis increasing in both Aand z,
dq(A,z)
dj=q(A,z)
w(A,z) bdyj(A,z)
dj, for j=A,z,
and it is straightforward to show that in this stationary environment the wage equa-
tion is given by
w(A,z) = ( 1 h)y(A,z) +hb+b(1 h)q(A,z)k.
Next, to make precise the comparison with an economy in which occupations
are segmented in many competitive labor markets, consider the same environment
as above, with the exception that workers can match instantly with ﬁrms. As be-
fore, we assume free entry (without vacancy costs), and constant returns to scale
production. This implies that every worker will earn his marginal product y(A,z).
Importantly, we keep the reallocation frictions the same: workers who change occu-
pations have to forgo production for a period, and arrive at a random labor market
in a different occupation at the end of the period. In the simple case of perma-
nent productivity (A,z), the value of being in a labor market with z, conditional on
y(A,z)>b, isWc(A,z) = y(A,z)/(1 b), where to simplify we have not consid-
ered job destruction shocks.
Block recursiveness, given the free entry condition, is preserved and decisions
are only functions of (A,z). Unemployed workers optimally choose to change oc-
cupations, and the optimal policy is a reservation quality, zr
c, characterised by the
following equation
bZ
maxfy(A,z),y(A,zr
c)gdF(z) + ( b c)(1 b) =y(A,zr
c).
The LHS describes the net beneﬁt of switching occupations, while the RHS the value

of of staying employed earning yin the (reservation) labor market.
Rearranging the above equations, the reservation z-productivities for the com-
petitive and frictional case satisfy, respectively,

q(q(p,z)),
which follows from the combination of the free entry condition and the Hosios. This
completes the proof of Lemma 3.
Implications of Lemma 3 We now show two implications of Lemma 3. First
we show that search frictions adds a procyclical force to occupational mobility deci-
sions. Choosing cc,csappropriately such that zr
c=zr, the above expressions imply
thatdzr

[Page 266 of 269]
Buth(y(A,z) b) (1 h)bqk=y(A,z) w(A,z)>0 and we have established
that search frictions within labor markets make occupational mobility decisions
more procyclical relative to the competitive benchmark, given the same F(z)and
the same initial reservation productivity zr=zr
c.
Second, we show that impact of the production function on the procyclicality of
occupational mobility decisions. Here we want to show that with search frictions, if
the production function is modular or supermodular (i.e. yAz0), there exists a c
0 under which occupational mobility decisions are procyclical. With competitive
markets, if the production function is modular, occupational mobility decisions are
countercyclical, for any b<1 and c0.
Note that modularity implies that yA(A,z) = yA(A,˜z),8z>˜z; while super-
modularity implies yA(A,z)yA(A,˜z),8z>˜z. Hence modularity implies

If we can show that the integral becomes large enough, for clarge enough, to domi-
nate the other terms, we have established the claim. First note thatyA(A,z)
yA(A,zr)is weakly
larger than 1, for z>zrby the (super)modularity of the production function. Next
consider the termq(A,z)(w(A,zr) b)
q(A,zr)(w(A,z) b). Note that
lim
z#y 1(b;A)q(A,z)
w(A,z) b=l(q(A,z))
1 b+bl(q(A,z))=0,
because q(A,z)#0, as y(A,zr)#b. Hence, ﬁxing a zsuch that y(A,z)>b,
q(A,z)(w(A,zr) b)
q(A,zr)(w(A,z) b)!¥, asy(a,zr)#b. Since this holds for any zover which is inte-
grated, the integral term becomes unboundedly large, making dzr/dAstrictly posi-
tive if reservation zris low enough. Since the integral rises continuously but slower
inzrthan the also continuous termq(A,zr)
1 b, it can be readily be established that zr
depends continuously on c, and strictly negatively so as long as y(A,zr)>band
F(z)has full support. Moreover, for some ¯clarge enough, y(A,zr) = b, where zris
a lower bound for zr. Hence, as c"zr,dzr/dA>0.

C.4.4 Proofs of Competitive Search Model
Proof of Lemma 4 Fix any occupation oand consider a ﬁrm that promised
WWU(A,z)to the worker with productivity z, delivers this value in such a way
that his proﬁt J(A,z,W)is maximized, i.e. solving (22). Now consider an alternative
offer ˆW6=W, which is also acceptable to the unemployed worker, and likewise
maximizes the proﬁt given ˆWfor the ﬁrm, J(A,z,ˆW). Then an alternative policy
that delivers Wby using the optimal policy for ˆW, but transfers additionally W ˆW
to the worker in the ﬁrst period must be weakly less optimal, which using the risk
neutrality of the worker, results in
J(A,z,W)J(A,z,ˆW) (W ˆW)
Likewise, an analogue reasoning implies J(A,z,ˆW)J(A,z,W) (ˆW W), which
together with the previous equation implies
J(A,z,W)J(A,z,ˆW) (W ˆW)J(A,z,W) (ˆW W) (W ˆW),
and hence it must be that J(A,z,W) = J(A,z,ˆW) (W ˆW), for all M (A,z)
W,ˆWWU. Differentiability of Jwith slope -1 follows immediately. Moreover,
M(A,z,W) =W+J(A,z,ˆW) +ˆW W=M(A,z,ˆW)M(A,z). Finally, if W0(A0,z0)<

WU(A0,z0)is offered tomorrow while M(A0,z0)>WU(A0,z0), it is a proﬁtable devi-
ation to offer WU(A0,z0), since M(A0,z0) WU(A0,z0) = J(A0,z0,WU(A0,z0))>0 is
feasible. This completes the proof of Lemma 4.
Proof of Lemma 5 Fix any occupation oand consider productivity z, such that
M(A,z) WU(A,z)>0. Since we conﬁne ourselves to this productivity, with
known continuation values J(A,z,W)and WU(A,z)in the production stage, we
drop the dependence on A,zfor ease of notation. Free entry implies k=q(q)J(W))
dW
dq<0. Notice that it follows that the maximand of workers in (20), subject to (24)
is continuous in W, and provided M>WU, has a zero at W=Mand at W=WU,
and a strictly positive value for intermediate W: hence the problem has an interior
maximum on [WU,M]. What remains to be shown is that the ﬁrst order conditions
are sufﬁcient for the maximum, and the set of maximizers is singular.
Solving the worker’s problem of posting an optimal value subject to tightness
implied by the free entry condition yields the following ﬁrst order conditions (with
multiplier m):
l0(q)[W WU] mq0(q)J(W) =0
l(q) mq(q)J0(W) =0

1. Introduction
Minimum wage legislation has been introduced and expanded in m any developed and developing countries in recent years, in
t h eh o p et h a ti tw o u l di m p r o v et h el i v i n gs t a n d a r d so ft h ep o o ra n dr educe inequality. Numerous studies have examined the effects
of the minimum wage on wages and employment to understand th e workings of labor markets, and some studies have examined
the effect on the distribution of household income to assess the achievement of policy goals ( Card and Krueger, 1995 ;Brown, 1999 ;
Neumark and Wascher, 2008 ). Nonetheless, to the best of my knowledge, no study has examined the effect on the distribution of
household consumption, even though a broad consensus exists that consumption is a better measure of welfare re ﬂecting expected
lifetime resources ( Cutler and Katz, 1991 ;Slesnick, 1993 ;Blundell et al., 2008 ;Meyer and Sullivan, 2008 ;Heathcote et al., 2010 ).
The impact of the minimum wage on the distribution of household consumption is not only empirically undocumented but also
theoretically ambiguous, as compared to the impact on the distribut ions of individual wages and household earnings. For simplicity of
exposition, suppose, for the moment, that the minimum wage covers all workers in the labor market. Then, raising the minimum wagewould push up the wages of workers at the bottom end of the w age distribution and can reduce wage inequality (see Lee, 1999 for the
United States; Bosch and Manacorda, 2010 for Mexico; and Kambayashi et al., 2013 for Japan). At the same time, however, raising theContents lists available at ScienceDirect

minimum wage may result in a reduction in employment of low-wage workers as the costs of hiring low-wage workers increase with a
rise in the minimum wage ( Neumark and Wascher, 2007 ). In addition, minimum wage workers are not necessarily at the bottom end of
the distribution of household earnings, a s their spouses may earn a lot more. For these reasons, raising the minimum wage may not
have a bene ﬁcial distributional effect on household earnings to the extent that it has on individual wages ( Card and Krueger, 1995 ;
Neumark and Wascher, 2008 ). The impact on the consumption distribution is eve n more ambiguous, since households choose their
consumption according to not only their current income but also their expectations about future income ( Deaton, 1992 ).
The adverse effect on employment tends to be more signi ﬁcant in the long term (de ﬁned as a few years after the minimum
wage increase) because of adjustment costs ( Baker et al., 1999 ). This means that low-wage workers may suffer an increased, if not
immediate, risk of losing their jobs. Even if they are able to switch their jobs in the long run, they may suffer an increase in
income uncertainty. Thus, the bene ﬁc i a le f f e c to ft h em i n i m u mw a g em a yb ea t t e n u a t e dm o r ef o rf u t u r ee a r n i n g s ,a n dh e n c e
consumption, than for current earnings. If one observes the impact on household consumption, the role that the minimum wagecan play in improving the living standards of the poor may be limit ed or perhaps negative. Nonetheless, little is known about the
impact on household consumption ( Aaronson et al., 2012 ), and nothing is known about the impact on consumption inequality.
This study examines the impact of large minimum wage changes on the distribution of living standards, as well as on
labor market outcomes; further, it quantitatively assesses their impact on household welfare. Since household welfaredepends on consumption and leisure, the welfare consequences of the minimum wage are less obvious. Even whenminimum wage hikes cause a reduction in demand for low-wage workers, some low-wage workers may enjoy more leisuretime without reducing consumption. Thus, raising the minimum wage may result in a welfare gain even in the absence of arise in consumption due to adverse effects on labor demand. In light of history, the minimum wage has been expanded toprotect low-wage workers against sweatshop practices. It is essential to evaluate the welfare gain from raising the minimumwage in terms of leisure as well as consumption. To the best of my knowledge, this study is the ﬁrst attempt to quantitatively
assess the welfare consequences of the minimum wage in terms of changes in consumption and leisure.
There has been growing attention in recent years towards the role of the minimum wage in developing countries
(Neumark et al., 2006 ;Alaniz et al., 2011 ). There are two important reasons for this. First, since the level of inequality is
higher in developing countries, there is a greater need for policies to improve the living standards of the poor and reduceinequality. Second, there is greater variation in minimum wages across regions and over time in developing countries, whichis very useful for identifying the impact of the minimum wage.
This study uses panel data from the Indonesian Family Life Surv ey (IFLS), covering the period from 1993 to 2000, to trace the
impact of the minimum wage on household welfare. In Indonesia, t he real value of the minimum wage rose sharply in the early 1990s
in large part due to international pressure against sweatshop pr actices, and it fell substantially in the late 1990s due to high in ﬂation
caused by the Asian ﬁnancial crisis. The extent to which the minimum wage wa s binding differed greatly across provinces as well as
over time, because of differences in the statutory minimum wage, w age structure, and industry composition. By exploiting the large
variation in the minimum wage, this study estimates the long- term effects of the minimum wage on the distribution of living
standards, as well as labor market outcomes. As is common in develop ing countries, informal employment is widespread in Indonesia.
Throughout the analysis, I distinguish between employment in the f ormal sector and employment in the informal sector. Furthermore,
I simulate the welfare effect if there were strict compliance with the minimum wage to understand the in ﬂuence of non-compliance.
The results obtained point to limitations of the minimum wage as a policy to improve the living standards of the poor and
reduce inequality. At the individual level, raising the minimum wage resulted in an increase in wages; however, it also resulted in areduction in hours of work and formal employment, and these effect s varied across time and gender. At the household level, raising
the minimum wage resulted in an increase in earnings in the middle and the lower tail of the distribution; however, an increase inearnings led to little increase in consumption in the middle and the lower tail of the distribution. Consequently, the welfare gainresulting from raising the minimum wage was small and attributable mostly to an increase in the leisure of low-wage workers.
These ﬁndings are complementary to those in MaCurdy (2015) , who demonstrate unintended and unattractive distributional effects
of the minimum wage caused by an increase in consumer prices under the assumption that raising the minimum wage has no
effect on employment or consumption.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. The next section describes changes in the minimum wage and the
macroeconomic environment in Indonesia. Section 3 presents econometric models used to estimate the effects of the
minimum wage on labor market outcomes and living standards. Section 4 describes the data and samples used in the
analysis. Section 5 presents estimation and simulation results. The ﬁnal section provides a summary and conclusions.
2. Changes in the minimum wage
The minimum wage was ﬁrst introduced in Indonesia in the early 1970s but was virtually ineffective until the late 1980s.
The government introduced new legislation in 1989 and drastically revised the minimum wage, as part of a response tointernational pressure against sweatshop practices and domestic pressure on the redistribution of gains from economicgrowth ( Rama, 2001 ). Since then, statutory minimum wages have been set with reference to the cost of a consumption
bundle with a minimum daily caloric intake as well as to national and local economic conditions.1Until 2000, these

conditions were assessed by provincial councils consisting of government, employer, and employee representatives
appointed by the Ministry of Manpower which has the ﬁnal word on regional minimum wages. Consequently, there have
been large differences in statutory minimum wages across regions.
Fig. 1 depicts the nominal and real value of the median monthly minimum wage in 13 selected provinces of Indonesia
during the period of this study, 1993 –2000. These 13 provinces consist of 4 provinces of Sumatra (North Sumatra, West
Sumatra, South Sumatra, and Lampung), 5 provinces of Java (DKI Jakarta, West Java, Central Java, DI Yogyakarta, and East Java),and 4 provinces of other major islands (Bali, West Nusa Tenggara, South Kalimantan, and South Sulawesi), where the IFLS was
originally conducted. The government sets the monthly minimum wage, calculated on the basis of standard working hours.
The minimum wage, however, applies not only to full-time employees, but also to non-full-time employees, who must also be
paid the daily minimum wage. During the 1993 –2000 period, the nominal value of the minimum wage steadily increased and
tripled. After adjusting for in ﬂation, however, we observe a rise and fall in the minimum wage. The real value of the minimum
wage (de ﬂated by the consumer price index) rose by 39 percent from 1993 to 1997, but fell by 30 percent from 1997 to 1999
due to high in ﬂation caused by the Asian ﬁnancial crisis. During the 1993 –1997 period, the implied annual rate of the increase
in the real value of the minimum wage was 9.8 percent, 1.7 times as high as the annual real GDP per capita growth rate of
5.8 percent. Minimum wage hikes in the early 1990s are, thus, striking as compared to changes in the macroeconomic
environment. Despite the economic expansion of the early and mid-1990s, the unemployment rate exhibited an upward trend
and increased from 2.8 to 6.1 percent, which seems indicative of the adverse effect of the minimum wage on employment.0102030

Many studies have examined the employment effect of the minimum wage in Indonesia ( Rama, 2001 ;Alatas and Cameron,
2008 ;Comola and Mello, 2011 ;Magruder, 2013 ).2The analysis of labor market outcomes in this study is different from that in
previous studies in a number of ways. For example, this study exploits variation in the minimum wage bite arising from
differences in not only the statutory minimum wage but also the wage structure and industry composition to estimate the
long-term effects on workers most directly affected by minimum wage changes. Moreover, this study estimates the effects of
the minimum wage on hours of work, as well as on formal and informal employment, conditional on individual-speci ﬁc effects
and province-speci ﬁc time trends, and allows the effects to differ before and after the Asian ﬁnancial crisis.
To reiterate, the aim of this study is to evaluate the welfare effect associated with changes in consumption and leisure,
which has not been considered in previous studies.
3. Econometric framework
This section presents econometric mode ls used to estimate the long-term effects of the minimum wage on labor market
outcomes and living standards. Each model is selected according to the nature of the outcome of interest and speci ﬁed in ways to
take advantage of the panel structure of the data and of the large variation in the effective minimum wage across regions and time.
3.1. Earnings, wages, and hours
In light of the prevalence of informal employment in Indonesia ( International Labour Organization, 2012 ), I distinguish
between employment in the formal (covered) sector and employment in the informal (uncovered) sector. I de ﬁne a
mutually exclusive and exhaustive categorical variable, eit, taking a value of 1 if individual iin year tis employed in the
private or public sector, excluding the agricultural sector, 2 if self-employed, an unpaid family worker, or an agriculturalworker, and 0 if not employed. The minimum wage covers employees in the private and public sectors, but not self-
employed, unpaid family workers, and agricultural workers, for whom it is impractical to enforce.
For the analysis of individual earnings, wages, and hours, I measure the degree to which individual iin province pin year
tis affected by the revision of the minimum wage, in a way similar to Neumark et al. (2006) .Id e ﬁne an indicator for
whether an individual iearns at or below the new minimum wage in the same province pin the next year tþ1a s

calculated using the standard working hours of 40 hours per week. In this way, I exploit regional and time variation in the
effective minimum wage arising from differences in the statutory minimum wage relative to the wage structure and industry
composition.

The parameter of interest is βty, which represents a percentage difference in earnings in the next survey year t0between
formal-sector workers whose wages in year tare less than or equal to the new minimum wage in year tþ1 and the rest of
workers, holding other relevant factors constant. To be speci ﬁc,β1993yrepresents a percentage difference in earnings three
years after the minimum wage hike in 1994, while β1997yrepresents a percentage difference in earnings two years after the
fall in the real value of the minimum wage due to high in ﬂation in 1998. The former is the effect on earnings before the
Asian ﬁnancial crisis, while the latter is the corresponding effect after it.
2Rama (2001) reports a negative effect for small ﬁrms but no effect for large ﬁrms using province-level data of the early 1990s. Alatas and Cameron
(2008) also report a negative effect for small establishments but no effect for large establishments using 1990 –1996 establishment-level data from
manufacturing industries in Greater Jakarta. Comola and Mello (2011) report a negative effect on formal employment but a positive effect on informal
employment using 1996 –2004 district-level data, whereas Magruder (2013) reports a positive effect on formal employment and a negative effect on
informal employment using 1990 –2000 district-level data. The estimates of the ﬁrst three studies are based on comparisons between provinces or districts,
while those of the fourth study are based on comparisons between cross-border district pairs. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages (se e
Neumark et al., 2014 , for an extensive discussion of this issue). The results of the ﬁrst three studies are consistent with a one-sector or two-sector
competitive model ( Brown, 1999 ). All these studies, except Alatas and Cameron (2008) , estimate only contemporaneous effects.

4The results remain unchanged if province-speci ﬁc linear time trends are replaced with province-speci ﬁc squared time trends. Neumark et al. (2014)
discuss in detail issues related to controls for region-speci ﬁc time trends.

models.K. Yamada / European Economic Review 87 (2016) 287 –303 290

possible to decompose the effect on earnings ( βty) into the effect on wages ( βtw) and the effect on hours ( βℓ
t) by performing
separate regressions of earnings, wages, and hours.6By doing so, the mechanism of the effect on earnings can be explored,
including whether raising the minimum wage has an effect on hours of work.7
In addition, robustness checks are performed by restricting the sample to formal-sector workers, male workers, and
female workers.
3.2. Formal, informal, and non-employment
For the analysis of employment, I measure the degree to which the minimum wage is binding in province pin year t,i na
way similar to Card (1992) , so that not only employed individuals but also non-employed individuals, for whom wages are
not observed, can be included in the sample. I de ﬁne the fraction of workers who earn at or below the new minimum wage

I consider a multinomial response model, which extends commonly used binary response models in a way that distinguishes
between employment in the formal sector, employment in the informal sector, and non-employment. Let αijdenote an individual-

represents a change in the probability of employment in year t0with respect to a 100 percentage-point change in the fraction of
workers affected by the revision of the minimum wage, holding other relevant factors constant.
To control for an individual-speci ﬁc effect in the multinomial response model, I use a correlated random-effects speci-
ﬁcation ( Mundlak, 1978 ;Chamberlain, 1982 ):

3.3. Household earnings, consumption, and assets
For the analysis of living standards, I measure the degree to which household hin province pin year tis affected by the
revision of the minimum wage, in a way similar to Aaronson et al. (2012) .Id e ﬁne the share of household earnings from

The parameter of interest is βtC, which represents a percentage change in household consumption in year t0with respect to a

factors constant. Differences in family structure are controlled for by adjusting household consumption expenditures using
the adult equivalent scale and by controlling for age of household head squared. Potential effects of the minimum wage on

living standards.

wage workers lose their jobs.K. Yamada / European Economic Review 87 (2016) 287 –303 291

the price of goods are controlled for not only by de ﬂating household consumption expenditures using the national con-
sumer price index but also by including year effects and province-speci ﬁc linear time trends.
In addition, the mechanism of the effect on household consumption is explored by estimating the effects of the mini-
mum wage on equivalized log household earnings (ln Yh;t0), household consumption inclusive of durables (ln Cþ
h;t0), and
household assets (ln Ah;t0).
I employ quantile regression methods to estimate the distributional impact of the minimum wage. Let τA0;1ðÞ denote
the quantile index. I use the correlated random-effects quantile regression model proposed by Abrevaya and Dahl (2008)
and Bache et al. (2013) :
Qxht;xh;τ ðÞ ¼ βC

where uht/C12/C12xht;xh/C24uniform 0 ;1ðÞ and xh¼xh;1993þxh;1997/C0/C12=. The aforementioned two studies demonstrate that this
approach outperforms in a short panel. However, the coef ﬁcient in the standard quantile regression represents the effect on
the conditional distribution of the outcome variable, and not the effect on the marginal (unconditional) distribution. In the
present context, the coef ﬁcients may be more easily interpretable if one estimates the effect on the unconditional dis-
tribution, rather than on the conditional distribution. Thus, I also use the unconditional quantile regression model proposedbyFirpo et al. (2009) . This method consists of performing a regression of a transformation (the recentered in ﬂuence
function) of the outcome variable on the regressors. Let q
τdenote the τth quantile of ln Ch;t0. The recentered in ﬂuence
function can be written as RIF ln Ch;t0;qτ/C0/C1¼b1;τ1lnCh;t04qτ/C8/C9þb2;τwhere b1;τ¼1fqτ/C0/C1/C14,b2;τ¼qτ/C01/C0τðÞ fqτ/C0/C1/C14, and fqτ/C0/C1is
the density of ln Ch;t0evaluated at qτ. The regressors used are the same as those in Eq. (8):
RIF ln Ch;t0;qτ/C0/C1¼βC
tτðÞshare htþzhtγCτðÞ þ xhξC
t0τðÞ: ð9Þ
In the linear speci ﬁcation, correlated random effects and ﬁxed effects are equivalent ( Mundlak, 1978 ).
The errors are presumably correlated within the unit of analysis. To allow for arbitrary forms of heteroscedasticity and
serial correlation, standard errors reported below are clustered at the individual or household level. Since cluster-robuststandard errors are biased when there are only a few dozen clusters ( Cameron and Miller, 2015 ), they are not clustered at
the province level in the analysis here. While panel-robust standard errors are considered to be conservative, they are not
substantially different from heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors in the analysis here.
4. Data and descriptive analysis
This section describes the data and characteristics of the samples used in the analysis.
4.1. Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS)
For the analysis of this study, I use data from the ﬁrst three waves of the IFLS conducted in 1993, 1997, and 2000.
8The
IFLS covers 13 of 27 provinces, representing more than 80 percent of the population in Indonesia, the fourth most populouscountry in the world. Importantly, for the aim of this study, the IFLS is a panel survey that collects detailed information on
consumption expenditures of households as well as employment status, earnings, and hours of work of household mem-
bers. The IFLS is known to have a low rate of attrition ( Thomas et al., 2012 ).
I construct two individual samples for the analysis of labor market outcomes and one household sample for the analysis of
living standards. I refer to the two individual samples as Sa mple IA and Sample IB and the household sample as Sample H.
Samples IA and IB comprise household heads and their spouse s aged between 15 and 65 years during the period from 1993 to
2000, while Sample H comprises households in which househo ld heads were aged between 15 and 65 years in the same period.
Sample IA is used in the analysis of earnings and hours and includes employed individuals whose earnings and hours wereobserved for the three consecutive waves, while Sample IB is u sed in the analysis of employment and includes both employed
and non-employed individuals regardless of wh ether their earnings and hours were observed.
9Sample H is used in the analysis
of household earnings, consumption, and assets and includes households in which either heads or spouses had labor earnings.
All these samples are restricted to individuals and households fo r whom all variables were available for two consecutive waves so
as to control for individual- and household-speci ﬁc effects. All individuals in Samples IA and IB are weighted by an individual
sampling weight, and all households in Sample H are weighted by a household sampling weight. Further details of sample
selection are presented in Table 10 inAppendix A.1 .
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the three samples regarding demographics in 1993 and 1997 and labor market
outcomes and living standards in 1997 and 2000 that are used in the regression analysis. I refer to employees in the private
and public sectors, excluding the agricultural sector, as formal-sector workers and to self-employed workers, unpaid family
workers, and agricultural workers as informal-sector workers. Hourly wages are calculated by dividing monthly earnings by

hours of work. Non-durable consumption expenditures comprise expenditures for food inclusive of home-produced food,
electricity, water, fuel, communication, personal toiletries, household items, domestic service, recreation and entertainment,
and transportation. Durable consumption expenditures comprise expenditures for clothing, household supplies and furniture,
and children's education. Household assets are total assets, excluding those used for business. The total assets comprise
housing, land, livestock, poultry, ﬁshpond, vehicles, household appliances, savings, stocks, receivables, jewelry, and household
furniture and utensils. In this broad de ﬁnition, household assets are greater than zero for almost all households in the sample.
Earnings, wages, consumption expenditures, and assets are all de ﬂated by the consumer price index with the base year of
2000. Household earnings, consumption expenditures, and assets are equivalized using the OECD scale.10
Looking at Sample IA, the mean monthly earnings did not change in real terms from 1997 to 2000, a period including the
Asian ﬁnancial crisis. Strati ﬁed by sector, the mean earnings of formal-sector workers decreased from 1997 to 2000, while
that of informal-sector workers increased over this period. The variance of log earnings increased in both the sectors from
1997 to 2000, and it was consistently higher in the informal sector than in the formal sector in both years. The mean hours
of work per week moderately declined in both the sectors from 1997 to 2000. Although the mean hours of work were not
very different between the two sectors in either year, the variance of log hours of work was substantially higher in the
informal sector than in the formal sector. The fraction of formal-sector workers was 38 percent during the sample period,
which is similar to the of ﬁcial labor market statistics ( International Labour Organization, 2012 ). This fraction decreased from
40 percent in 1997 to 35 percent in 2000, while the fraction of informal-sector workers increased from 60 to 65 percent.
This implies that some workers moved from the formal sector to the informal sector. In both years, most of the informal-
sector workers were self-employed workers. The fraction of male workers was higher in the formal sector than in theTable 1

Notes : Sample means reported are those of demographics in 1993 and 1997 (columns 2 and 3, respectively) and those of labor market outcomes and living
standards in 1997 and 2000 (columns 2 and 3, respectively). The variances of log in square brackets are those calculated after trimming the top and bott om
0.5 percent. Sample IA includes only employed individuals whose earnings and hours were observed for the three consecutive waves, while Sample IBincludes both employed and non-employed individuals regardless of whether their earnings and hours were observed. Earnings, consumption expendi-tures, and assets are measured in 10,000 Indonesian rupiahs ( C1 US dollar in December 2000) and de ﬂated by the consumer price index with the base
year of 2000. Household earnings, consumption expenditures, and assets are equivalized using the OECD scale. The number of observations for househo ld
assets is 3032 ( ¼1516 /C22 years), due to additional missing values.
10The use of adult equivalence scales assumes that consumption is split equally among adults within a household. It is beyond the scope of this paper
to relax this assumption (see Lise and Seitz, 2012 , for an extension of the approach).K. Yamada / European Economic Review 87 (2016) 287 –303 293

informal sector in both years. The mean age of workers was consistently higher in the informal sector than in the formal
sector in both years. Looking at Sample IB, the employment rate increased from 73 percent in 1997 to 81 percent in 2000,
and this increase roughly corresponds to an increase in the fraction of informal-sector workers. In both Samples IA and IB,
the mean age of individuals was 38 in 1993 and 42 in 1997.
Looking at Sample H, both the mean equivalized household ear nings and the mean equivalized consumption expenditures
increased moderately from 1997 to 2000. A small difference between the two indicates that the average households did not savemuch. While the variance of log household earnings was not very different from the variance of log individual earnings in either
year, the variance of log household consumption expenditures was substantially lower than the variance of log individual earnings
in both years, indicating that households had access to some insu rance against shocks to labor earnings. Compared to developed
countries such as the United States ( Heathcote et al., 2010 ), the variance of log household consumption expenditures was higher,
but to a much lesser extent than the variance of log household e arnings. The mean equivalized household assets increased
moderately from 1997 to 2000. As is usually the case, the varianc e of log household assets was even higher than the variance of log
household earnings in both years. As the mean age of household heads increased, the mean number of adults (aged 17 years and
older) increased slightly, while the mean number of children (aged 16 years and younger) decreased slightly.
4.2. Minimum wage bite
The real value of the minimum wage rose rapidly in the early 1990s and fell substantially in the late 1990s. On observing
its changes in the survey years, it is seen that it rose by 26 percent from 1993 to 1994 and fell by 27 percent from 1997 to
1998. Variation in minimum wage changes across provinces arises from differences in the statutory minimum wage, wage
structure, and industry composition.
Table 2 reports the sample means of bind and share by province and year. The mean of bind by province and year is identical
tofrac, the fraction of workers affected by the revision of the minimum wage. There is a great deal of variation in bind and
share across provinces and over time. To be speci ﬁc,fracdiffered greatly across provinces in both years, ranging between 2 and
15 percent in 1993 and between 2 and 18 percent in 1997. Moreover, frac evolved differently over time; for example, in
5 provinces of Java, it increased from 15 to 18 percent in DKI Jakarta and from 9 to 12 percent in DI Yogyakarta, decreased from13 to 12 percent in West Java and from 10 to 9 percent in Central Java, and remained constant at 15 percent in East Java. The
same is true of share . Part of their variation is due to the difference in the statutory minimum wage relative to wage dis-
tribution, as seen from the difference in bind in the formal sector (columns 5 and 6). The rest of their variation is due to the
difference in industry composition, as seen from the difference in the fraction of formal-sector workers (columns 7 and 8).
Table 3 reports the sample means of bind and share by quintile of equivalized household earnings and non-durable con-
sumption expenditures. The purpose of the minimum wage leads us to expect that it would be binding most signi ﬁcantly at
the bottom end of the earnings distribution. However, the means of bind and share were higher in the second and third
quintiles than in the ﬁrst quintile (columns 1 –4). The reasons for this result are twofold. First, spouses of minimum wage
workers were not necessarily low-wage workers but were sometimes high-wage workers. The correlation of spousal earnings
was only 1 percent in the data. Second, the fraction of informal-sector workers was disproportionately higher among lower-
earnings households. The majority of workers in the ﬁrst and second quintiles of household earnings were not employed in
the formal sector (columns 5 and 6). The fraction of formal-sector workers in the ﬁrst quintile of household earnings was only
10 percent in 1993 and 16 percent 1997. These ﬁgures are almost identical to the fraction of workers affected in columns 1 andTable 2

2, meaning that almost all formal-sector workers in the ﬁrst quintile of household earnings received at or below the next
year's minimum wage. The means of bind and share decline gradually with household earnings and consumption expendi-
tures, but not to zero. This result indicates that some individuals in the upper tail of the earnings and consumption dis-
tributions could bene ﬁt from raising the minimum wage. To summarize, the minimum wage was not effectively targeted at
individuals at the bottom end of the distributions of household earnings and consumption.
Given these results, it is likely that the impact of the minimum wage would be greater around the middle of the earnings
distribution (such as, the 30th and 50th percentiles) than at the bottom end (such as, the 10th percentile). It is also likelythat the impact of the minimum wage would be present in the upper tail of the earnings distribution. Without controlling
for other relevant factors, however, these arguments are not conclusive. Moreover, consumption depends on not only
current income but also expectations about income. Even assuming arguendo that raising the minimum wage resulted in anincrease in household earnings, an important empirical question remains as to the extent to which an increase in householdearnings resulting from raising the minimum wage would be translated into an increase in household consumption.
5. Results
This section presents estimation results on labor market outcomes (including earnings, wages, hours, and employment
status) and living standards (including equivalized household earnings, consumption, and assets).
5.1. Labor market outcomes
Individual earnings .Table 4 presents the estimates for the effects of the minimum wage on individual earnings, wages,
and hours, separately for all workers, male workers, female workers, and formal-sector workers in Sample IA. The resultsindicate that raising the minimum wage had a positive and signi ﬁcant effect on earnings for all workers, male workers, and
formal-sector workers, but not for female workers.
The effect on earnings can be decomposed into a positive effect on wages and a negative effect on hours for all groups of
workers. The estimates for all workers indicate that wages of minimum wage workers increased 28 percent more thanwages of the rest of workers, while hours of work of minimum wage workers decreased 12 percent more than hours of workof the rest of workers. As a result of these two opposing effects, minimum wage workers experienced a 16 percent greaterincrease in earnings than the rest of workers. After restricting the sample to formal-sector workers, all the effects are greaterin magnitude, but the pattern of the results remains the same.
Comparing the effects of the minimum wage between male and female workers, the negative effect on hours is greater in
magnitude for female workers than for male workers, while the positive effect on wages is greater in magnitude for maleworkers than for female workers. The greater effect on hours for female workers seems to re ﬂect the ease of hour adjustments.
Of formal-sector workers, 52 percent of women were part-time workers (de ﬁned as those working less than 40 hours per
week), while 29 percent of men were part-time workers. The wage effect can be obscured by the loss of employment. The
smaller effect on wages for female workers seems to re ﬂect their weaker attachment to the labor market. While male workers
experienced an increase in earnings as the wage effect exceeded the hour effect, female workers did not experience such anincrease as the hour effect was large enough to offset the wage effect. To summarize, the government can raise wages ofminimum wage workers by setting the minimum wage higher; however, it is then no longer cost-effective for ﬁrms to hireTable 3

minimum wage workers, and hence, the bene ﬁt of increased wages can be offset by a reduction in hours of work. The effect of
the reduction in hours of work on household welfare depends on whether it is accompanied by a reduction in consumption.
When allowing the coef ﬁcient to vary across years, the earnings effect is smaller after the Asian ﬁnancial crisis for both
men and women as a result of the greater hour effect. This result indicates a more signi ﬁcant reduction in hours of work
after a negative shock to the economy. The presence of the minimum wage seems to destabilize employment for low-skilledworkers who are vulnerable to an economic slump.
Employment .Table 5 presents the estimates for the marginal effects, evaluated at the sample means, of the minimum wage on the
probabilities of formal employment, informal employment, and no n-employment, separately for all individuals, men, and women in
Sample IB. The results indicate that the effect of the minimum wage is negative on the probability of being employed in the formal
sector, mixed on the probability of being employed in the informal sector, and positive on the proba bility of not being employed.
For men, the marginal effect of the minimum wage is negative on the probability of being employed in the formal sector
but positive on the probability of being employed in the informal sector. Both of the effects are economically and statisticallysigniﬁcant. The estimates indicate that a 10 percentage-point increase in the fraction of workers affected reduces the prob-
ability of being employed in the formal sector by 12 percent and raises the probability of being employed in the informal sector
by 10 percent. The decreased probability of being employed in the formal sector is as large as the increased probability of being
employed in the informal sector, indicating a shift of male workers from the formal sector to the informal sector. This resultimplies that male minimum wage workers experienced an increase in the risk to earnings, as the variance of log earnings washigher in the informal sector than in the formal sector. Given the fact that informal-sector workers are typically not entitled tosocial insurance, the impact of increased instability of household income would not be negligible.Table 4

For women, the marginal effect is negative on the probability of being employed in the formal sector and the probability
of being employed in the informal sector and positive on the probability of not being employed. None of the effects isstatistically signi ﬁcant when marginal effects are ﬁxed over time, but the sign and size of the effect on the probability of not
being employed suggests possibility of employment loss. The negative effect on informal employment can be interpreted as
female workers in the informal sector being crowded out by male workers who moved from the formal sector to the
informal sector.
When allowing the marginal effect to vary across years, the negative effect on formal employment, as well as hours of
work, is greater after the crisis for both men and women. This result implies that employment adjustments in the formal
sector are more common in a period of economic recession. The adverse effect on total employment for women is signi ﬁcant
not after but before the crisis; however, this can be explained by the decreased negative effect on informal employment as aresult of the shift of female workers from the formal sector to the informal sector after the crisis.
5.2. Living standards
Mean effect .Table 6 presents the estimates for the mean effects of the minimum wage on equivalized household
earnings, consumption, and assets for households in Sample H. The results indicate that raising the minimum wage had apositive and signi ﬁcant effect on household earnings, but not on household consumption. The effect on household con-
sumption is less than one-third of the effect on household earnings. The effect on household earnings is similar to the effect
on individual earnings, in the sense that equivalized earnings of households in which both heads and spouses wereminimum wage workers increased 16 percent more than equivalized earnings of households in which neither heads norspouses were minimum wage workers. This means, however, that the effect on household earnings is half of the effect onindividual earnings for households in which either heads or spouses were minimum wage workers.
Equivalized consumption of households in which both heads and spouses were minimum wage workers increased only
4 percent more when excluding durables and only 5 percent more when including durables than equivalized consumptionof households in which neither heads nor spouses were minimum wage workers. There was no change in the effect onconsumption before and after the crisis, while an increase in household earnings and assets was more signi ﬁcant before the
crisis. Taken together, an increase in earnings resulting from raising the minimum wage was at best only partially translated
into an increase in consumption. This implies that households would save the increased amount of earnings. Indeed,equivalized assets of minimum wage households in which both heads and spouses were minimum wage workers increased14 percent more than equivalized assets of households in which neither heads nor spouses were minimum wage workers.
An important implication of these results is that an increase in household earnings after minimum wage hikes result in little
increase in permanent income. The main reason for this is considered to be an increased risk to earnings due to a decrease informal employment for men and an increase in non-employment for women.
11Political instability may be another reason that
households view an increase in earnings resulting from raising the minimum wage as temporary. It may also be worth notingthat, if workers earned at the minimum wage only in the begin ning of their careers and always earned more than the minimum
wage later in their careers, raising the minimum wage would result in only marginal increases in permanent income. Although
this is not the case in Indonesia, the effect on consump tion can be inherently limited in some other countries.Table 6

11Another possibility is that minimum wage households might have anticipated a rise in the minimum wage, and hence, increased consumption at the
time of receiving the news of the revision, not necessarily after the revision of the minimum wage. This interpretation has two problems, however. Fir st,
political instability in Indonesia were presumably high enough not to be able to anticipate policy changes a few years in advance with con ﬁdence. Second, if
anticipation played a key role, the effect on household consumption should have been greater after 1997 than after 1993, as the fall in the real value of the
minimum wage in the late 1990s due to high in ﬂation caused by the Asian ﬁnancial crisis was far less anticipated than the steady rise in the minimum wage
in the early 1990s.K. Yamada / European Economic Review 87 (2016) 287 –303 297

Distributional impact .Table 7 presents the conditional and unconditional quantile regression estimates for the effects of
the minimum wage on equivalized household earnings and consumption. For ease of reference, it presents only the case oftime-constant coef ﬁcient, as the effect of the minimum wage on consumption is not signi ﬁcantly different across years
(Table 6 ). The conditional and unconditional quantile regression estimates are broadly consistent. The greatest effect of the
minimum wage is found at the 30th percentile of the earnings distribution. Raising it had only a small and statisticallyinsigni ﬁcant effect at the 10th percentile of the earnings distribution, as the majority of individuals were not employed in
the formal sector. The effect is statistically signi ﬁcant but smaller in magnitude at the middle and upper tails of the earnings
distribution, and disappears at the 90th percentile in the unconditional earnings distribution.
The unconditional quantile regression estimates for the effect on household consumption are not as heterogeneous
across the distribution as those for the effect on household earnings. The effects are slightly greater at the 50th and 70thpercentiles. Importantly, the effect on household consumption is substantially smaller in magnitude at the 30th, 50th, and70th percentiles than the effect on household earnings. The effect on household consumption becomes slightly greaterwhen including durables than when excluding durables, a result consistent with the notion of intertemporal substitutionthat luxuries are easier to postpone ( Browning and Crossley, 2000 ). Nonetheless, the effect on household consumption
inclusive of durables is almost zero at the 30th percentile and statistically signi ﬁcant only at the 70th percentile. Even in the
latter case, the effect on household consumption is only half of the effect on household earnings. These results imply that an
increase in household earnings resulting from raising the minimum wage did not increase the permanent income of low-income households, while it could moderately raise the permanent income of median- and high-income households.
The bottom rows of Table 7 present the estimates for the effects on earnings and consumption inequality, measured by
the differences between the 90th and 10th percentiles, between the 70th and 30th percentiles, and between the 50th and
10th percentiles. The distributional impact of the minimum wage is indeed more limited, if one observes the impact on
household consumption rather than on household earnings. Therefore, raising the minimum wage had an effect, though notstatistically signi ﬁcant, of reducing the 70 –30 earnings gap, but it did not have an effect of reducing the interquantile range
of the consumption distribution.
5.3. Household welfare
The analysis ends with a quantitative assessment of the welfare effect. I consider the welfare gain resulting from the
minimum wage hike from 1993 to 1994. I do not consider the minimum wage change from 1997 to 1998, as it was causedmainly due to the Asian ﬁnancial crisis. The approach taken here follows Jones and Klenow (2016) , which is referred to as
the empirical approach in Heathcote et al. (2013) . The advantage of this approach is that it requires no assumption on
household behavior or market structure. I extend their analysis by incorporating spousal labor supply and attempt tomeasure the average welfare gain of households, not of individuals.
In the analysis here, the household utility, uC
t;ℓm
t;ℓf
t/C16/C17
, is determined by the equivalized household non-durable con-
sumption ( Ct) and the hours of work of husband ( ℓtm) and of wife ( ℓtf). Let ~Ct0and ~ℓg

. The calculation of the welfare gain resulting
from the minimum wage hike is based on comparing expected utilities in 1997 between the actual case, where the real value
of the minimum wage increased from 1993 to 1994, and the counterfactual case, where the real value of the minimum wage
did not change from 1993 to 1994. Consider a utilitarian social welfare function, in which equal weight is given to all
households. The welfare gain resulting from the minimum wage increase from year tto year tþ1 can be represented as an
increased amount of consumption ( λ) needed to equalize the actual and counterfactual expected utilities in year t0as

can be calculated using the estimates for the effects of the minimum wage on consumption, hours, and employment status
when the effects are constant over time. Details of the calculation are presented in Appendix A.2 .
As in the analysis of Jones and Klenow (2016) , I assume that preferences are additively separable between consumption
and hours, logarithmic in consumption, and constant relative risk aversion in hours: uC ;ℓm;ℓf/C0/C1¼lnCþθmvℓmðÞ þ θfvℓf/C0/C1,
where vℓgðÞ ¼ ℓgðÞ1þσg1þσg/C0/C1/C14forgAm;f/C8/C9. The parameter θgcaptures the utility weight on hours relative to con-
sumption, and 1 σg/C14measures the Frisch elasticity of labor supply. For a given speci ﬁcation of preferences, the consumption-
equivalent welfare change can be calculated as the sum of the effects of changes in household consumption, husband's
hours, and wife's hours:

Estimation results indicate that the ﬁrst effect is likely to be small but positive ( Table 7 ), and the second and third effects are
also likely to be positive ( Tables 4 and 5).
Table 8 reports the value of λ, which indicates by how much consumption should increase so as to equalize the expected
utilities with and without the minimum wage hike, for different levels of distaste for work θgand the Frisch elasticity 1 σg/C14and
for different levels of compliance. Sample H is used for the welfare calculation. Following the analysis of Jones and Klenow
(2016) ,Ic o n s i d e r σm¼σf¼σ¼1a n d θm¼θf¼θ¼/C015 as benchmark values.12When σranges from 0.5 to 2.0 and θranges
from /C020 to /C010, the welfare gain varies from 0.4 to 2.4 percent (columns 1 –3). The welfare gain becomes greater and varies
from 0.7 to 5.5 percent if there were strict compliance with the minimum wage (columns 4 –6). In the latter calculation, I
consider the counterfactual case, where all households in the lower tail of the distribution experienced the same increase inhousehold consumption as those at the median of the distribution, and informal-sector workers experienced the same changein employment and hours as formal-sector workers. The welfare gain varies with parameters
θandσ, and becomes greater
under strict compliance. Nonetheless, the welfare gain is consistently small as compared to a 26 percent increase in the realvalue of the minimum wage, despite a large change in the parameter values and the level of compliance.

This decomposition implies that the welfare gain would increase with a rise in the level of consumption and leisure but would
decrease with a rise in inequality in consumption and leisure. The advantage of the decomposition is that it requires noassumption on the distribution of consumption or hours of work.
Table 9 reports the results of the decomposition for the benchmark case. The welfare gain associated with changes in both
the level and inequality of consumption is positive but small. Regardless of the level of compliance, only a trivial fraction of thetotal welfare effect is attributable to changes in the level and inequality of consumption. These results remain the same evenwhen including durables. The welfare gain resulting from the minimum wage hike is attributable mostly to changes in thelevel and inequality of leisure. In particular, one-half of the total welfare effect can be accounted for by an increase in the level
of leisure for men, as they are more likely to be employed than women are. The welfare effect remains largely unchanged if
there were no effect of the minimum wage on employment, indicating that the welfare gain results mainly from a reduction inhours of work unassociated with a change in the sector. Overall, the welfare gain re ﬂects the fact that some households could
enjoy more leisure time without an accompanying decrease in consumption after the minimum wage hike. A key caveat of the
analysis is the possibility that raising the minimum wage might have an adverse effect on educational attainment as a result of
an increase in the opportunity cost of attending school. When this effect is considered, the welfare gain would be even smaller.
6. Conclusion
The minimum wage has received much attention across the world in recent years. In East Asia, it was introduced in Hong
Kong in 2011 and Malaysia in 2013 and has risen substantially in many countries, such as China, Indonesia, and Japan, as a
way to improve the living standards of the poor and reduce inequality. In Europe, it has been introduced in Germany in
2015. In the United States, the minimum wage has been discussed as a stimulus to boost the economy. The popularity of theminimum wage seems to stem from a feeling of hope for improved welfare among people and from ﬁscal problems making
it difﬁcult for governments to implement welfare reforms. Given concerns about the long-term adverse effects that would
undermine the employment of low-wage workers and the international competitiveness of ﬁrms, further investigation has
been needed to understand the bene ﬁcial effect that the minimum wage could have on household welfare.
The aim of this study has been to evaluate the ef ﬁcacy of the minimum wage by tracing the impact of large minimum wage
changes on household welfare. To this end, this study used panel data on earnings, hours, and consumption from Indonesia,
which saw major changes in the real value of the minimum wage in the 1990s. The results obtained point to undesirable
consequences of the minimum wage as a policy to improve the living standards of the poor and reduce inequality. Low-wageworkers experienced an increase in wages after minimum wage hikes; however, at the same time there was a reduction inhours of work and formal employment. Raising the minimum wage had a signi ﬁcant effect on household earnings in the
middle and the lower tail of the distribution; however, it had little effect on household consumption, re ﬂecting an increased
risk to earnings. Consequently, raising the minimum wage had no effect in reducing consumption inequality between the poor
and the rich. The welfare gain was small and mostly attributable to changes in the level and inequality of leisure.Table 9

Abstract
In an era of rapid technological advancements and macroeconomic shifts, worker reallocation
is necessary, yet responses to labor market shocks remain sluggish, making it crucial to identify
bottlenecks in occupational transitions to understand labor market dynamics and improve mo-
bility. In this study, we analyze French occupational data to uncover patterns of worker mobility
and pinpoint specific occupations that act as bottlenecks which impede rapid reallocation. We
introduce two metrics, transferability and accessibility, to quantify the diversity of occupational
transitions and find that bottlenecks can be explained by a condensation effect of occupations
with high accessibility but low transferability. Transferability measures the variety of transitions
from an occupation to others, while accessibility assesses the variety of transitions into an
occupation. We provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing occupational complexity and
mobility patterns, offering insights into potential barriers and pathways for efficient retraining
programs. We argue that our approach can inform policymakers and stakeholders aiming to
enhance labor market efficiency and support workforce adaptability.
1 Introduction
Reallocating workers across occupations is crucial for resilient labor markets, allowing economies to
adapt to technological innovations and economic fluctuations. However, this process often encounters
challenges. Structural barriers, such as skill mismatches and occupational rigidities, can impede the
smooth transition of workers (Ad˜ ao, Beraja, & Pandalai-Nayar, 2022), and the presence of bottleneck
occupations further contributes to sluggish reallocation (Bocquet, 2022). As labor markets evolve
with automation and digital transformation, understanding the mechanisms that hinder worker
transitions becomes increasingly important. For example, innovations like Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) are diminishing the need for repetitive tasks, potentially affecting 44% of
working hours in impacted industries (Ghosh, Wilson, & Castagnino, 2023). At the same time, there
is a growing demand for workers in technology-related roles, such as information security specialists
(Di Battista et al., 2023), which underscores the need for effective worker reallocation.

[Page 2 of 57]
In this paper, we investigate the question of how to identify occupations that may impede rapid
reallocation of workers across occupations using a fitness and complexity-inspired method. Our main
contribution is the development of novel, data-driven metrics for accessibility and transferability
that quantify occupational mobility and effectively identify bottleneck occupations in the labor
market. Transferability is a measure of the diversity of potential destinations when leaving a given
occupation, while accessibility is a measure of the diversity of different occupations from which a
given occupation can be accessed. Using these metrics, we identify condenser occupations, with low
transferability and high accessibility, that act as bottlenecks in occupational transitions.
It is important to note that when we refer to bottlenecks orcondenser occupations, we do so in
a descriptive manner. These terms are used to characterize structural features of the observed
transition network, highlighting areas of low inter-community mobility or high condensation, without
implying any normative judgment about the labor market’s optimal functioning.
We apply our framework to the French labor market using employer tax data from 2012 to 2020 to
construct year-on-year occupational transition matrices (Section 3.1). The transition matrix exhibits
an inherent block structure, with, on average, only one out of six occupations per block exhibiting
significant inter-block transitions (Section 3.2). The implied steady state of this occupational
transition matrix is far from the current distribution of workers across occupations. Over half
of the occupations deviate more than 10% from the implied steady state distribution (Section
3.3). Furthermore, transitions into and out of the employed labor force account for ∼40% of
all inter-community transitions, suggesting the existence of important barriers hindering direct
movement between occupational communities (Section 3.4).
To identify the occupations acting as bottlenecks to reallocation we introduce two metrics: trans-
ferability and accessibility. Transferability quantifies the diversity of outside options for a given
occupation, while accessibility quantifies the diversity of pathways to a given occupation (Section 4.1).
This enables us to classify occupations into four categories: (1) Hub, (2) Diffuser, (3) Channel, and
(4) Condenser occupations. Overall, 93% of occupations are condensers, which emerge as bottleneck
occupations due to their low transferability but high accessibility: many workers can transition into
these occupations but they offer limited follow-on opportunities. This aligns with human capital
theory, which posits that as workers gain experience and accumulate occupation-specific skills, their
incentives to transition to different occupations decrease, resulting in lower mobility over time
(Becker, 2009; Marginson, 2019). Our framework complements this theory by introducing metrics
that quantify the structural properties of actual transitions, offering a novel perspective on the
constraints in labor reallocation while remaining consistent with the underlying principles of human
capital theory.
Furthermore, we find that transferability is negatively correlated with the number of employees
in a given occupation. In Section 4.2, we show that our accessibility metric successfully identifies
occupations with high betweenness centrality, a metric commonly used in the literature to determine
bottlenecks. In particular, occupations with high accessibility show high skill similarity with
occupations inside andoutside of the community, making them the entry-points for inter-community
transitions.
Our main contribution to the literature is the additional information gained from the transferability
metric. Specifically, occupations with high transferability have a high skill similarity to occupations
outside of the community, thus serving as the origins of inter-community occupational transitions.
Together with the negative relationship between transferability and the number of employees in

an occupation, it is these occupations that may be at the heart of slow labor reallocation. To
demonstrate how these metrics can effectively inform policy interventions, Section 5 illustrates that
leveraging both transferability and accessibility metrics can help identify occupations for targeted
policies aimed at reducing frictions in the labor market.
2 Literature Review
At the macro-level, structural shifts may be attributed to technological advancements (Atalay,
Phongthiengtham, Sotelo, & Tannenbaum, 2018) or macroeconomic events such as the “China
Shock” (Autor, Dorn, & Hanson, 2021) or the COVID-19 pandemic (Cortes & Forsythe, 2023).
Empirical evidence suggests that worker reallocation following structural shocks is a slow process
(Autor et al., 2021; Dix-Carneiro, Pessoa, Reyes-Heroles, & Traiberman, 2023). Understanding the
reasons for slow worker reallocation is crucial, as it may influence policymakers’ decisions on labor
market interventions, particularly in the context of pandemic-induced job market shifts, the green
transition, and the impacts of automation.
Several factors have been identified as contributing to slow worker reallocation. First, skills are often
imperfectly transferable between occupations, leading to mismatches that impede transitions (Ad˜ ao
et al., 2022; Bocquet, 2022; Buera, Kaboski, Rogerson, & Vizcaino, 2022). Ad˜ ao et al. (2022) finds
that, in occupations with strong skill specificity, the pace of labor market adjustments slows down
because the transition relies less on reallocating older workers and more on gradually integrating
younger workers into these roles. Bocquet (2022) was the first to highlight and quantify the role
of bottleneck or “bridge occupations” on the speed of reallocation. He finds that reallocation is
significantly slowed down due to the structure of the occupation network and emphasizes that the
impact of skill frictions can be effectively modeled within a search and matching framework, making
the underlying effects more tractable.
Second, local labor markets are often imperfectly connected on an occupational and sectoral level
(Dix-Carneiro et al., 2023; Schmutz & Sidib´ e, 2020). Kline and Moretti (2013) emphasize geographical
barriers, suggesting that labor markets in highly competitive and productive cities are not well-
connected, leading to a scarcity of occupational transitions. Schmutz and Sidib´ e (2020) develop a
general equilibrium search and matching model to incorporate these geographical frictions.
Third, recent approaches emphasize analyzing labor flows and their network patterns to understand
occupational mobility, which tracks workers’ transitions through a complex network based on various
attributes (Bocquet, 2022; del Rio-Chanona, Mealy, Beguerisse-D´ ıaz, Lafond, & Farmer, 2021; Joyez
& Laffineur, 2022; Schmutte, 2014).
Incorporating skill data into analyses of labor flows has revealed that skill-relatedness not only
facilitates labor transitions between occupations but also promotes regional diversification and local
industry growth (Jara-Figueroa, Jun, Glaeser, & Hidalgo, 2018; Neffke & Henning, 2013; Neffke,
Otto, & Weyh, 2017; O’Clery & Kinsella, 2022). A recent study by Aufiero, De Marzo, Sbardella, and
Zaccaria (2024) investigates the relationship between job fitness, skill coherence, and wages in the US
labor market by employing network-based tools from the Economic Complexity framework. Going
beyond these studies, we here relate network properties to slow worker reallocation by developing a
set of metrics to measure and understand the patterns that lead to slow reallocation.

3 Occupational Transition Network of France
Using micro-data covering all employees in France, we construct an occupational transition network
for the period 2012-2020 (Section 3.1) to identify bottlenecks in labor flows by examining the labor
market’s implied steady state, community structure, and entry and exit dynamics. We observe a
scarce transition matrix with a strong community structure, where only 9% of all transitions occur
across communities (Section 3.2), and with over half of all occupations deviating by over 10% from
their implied steady state (Section 3.3). Furthermore, we show that, on average, 40% of the total
inflow to each occupational community originates from outside the labor market. These results
indicate that there are significant constraints in the reallocation of workers in the French labor
market, which appears to be out of its equilibrium state.

[Page 5 of 57]
3.1 Constructing the Occupational Transition Network
The object of analysis is the right-stochastic occupational transition matrix PT
i,j, where each entry
PT
i,j=P(XT
i=i|XT−1
j=j) (1)
corresponds to the realized transition rate from occupation jto occupation ifor the period (T-1,
T). The matrix is normalized such thatP
iPT
i,j= 1, and can be interpreted an observation of the
underlying probability of a transition from jtoi. The matrix Pi,jdefines a weighted directed
network of occupational transitions that is visually represented in Figure 1.
To estimate Pi,j, we use the BTS-POSTES dataset provided by the National Institute of Statistics
and Economic Studies of France (INSEE).1The dataset covers all employees in France for a sequence
of two-year snapshots, such that one can track an individual through the years T−1 and T. To
construct Pi,j, we consider an individual’s change in primary occupation within a ( T−1, T) year
period. The primary occupation is defined as occupation with the highest net salary provided that
at least 30 days have been worked in the job and the salary is at least the minimum wage.2If an
individual does not have a primary occupation we classify them as out of the occupational network.
Given each individual’s primary jobs in T−1 and T, we then consider their change in occupation.3
We thus focus on the network of year-on-year occupational transitions.
We aggregate all year-on-year observations for the years 2012-2020. In total, we account for 253.3
million person-year observations, among which 41.2 million (16.2%) undergo primary-to-primary
occupational transitions and 184.9 million (73.0 %) remain in the same occupation, 10.9 million
(4.3%) leave the network and 16.3 million (6.5%) enter the occupational network. The box-plot in
Figure 2(a) shows the regression coefficients of the year-specific transition matrices in comparison
to 2012, implying that it is reasonable to assume temporal stability for the purposes of this paper
(see Appendix B).4The combination of the matrices across the years yields 372 distinct occupation
codes (PCS-ESE), as we retain the occupations that are present in all years. Consequently, we
removed observations of occupation codes not present in all years from the dataset, which account
for 10.0 million person-year datums (3.7%). The construction of Pi,jnaturally excludes job changes
where an individual has an extended unemployment spell, whether this be due to actively searching
for a job, training, leaving or entering the workforce, or entering extended periods of leave such
as maternity leave. Furthermore, we do not account for changes in companies or location if the
individuals remain within the same occupational code.
To mitigate noise effects, links between two occupations are removed if the flow is below a fraction
Θ = 1% from the originating occupation.5For Θ = 0% each occupation connects to 278 other
occupations on average, with many connections due to a few individuals transitioning. With the
filtering process we remove 5 .3% of observations from the data which results in a total of 6900

2The indicator is defined by INSEE and is called PPS. In case of a tie, the job with the highest number of hours
worked is taken. The minimum salary threshold refers to the minimum wage for full-time, full-month employment in
France, ensuring that primary occupations considered in the analysis meet a baseline for economic activity.
3An occupation is defined by the nomenclatures of Professions and Socio-professional Categories of Salaried Jobs
of Private and Public Employers (PCS-ESE). Here we use the 4-digit PCE-ESE nomenclature

existing links, with 18 links per occupation on average. This magnitude aligns with estimates
provided by France Travail’s ROME job classification system,6where an average of 13 transitions
per occupation is deemed possible, considering similar skill and work environments.
Note that in studying occupational transitions, two types of networks are commonly considered: the
skill-based network (see e.g. Bocquet (2022); Grigsby (2022)) and the observed transition network,
which is the focus of this study. The skill-based network uses measures of skill similarity to map
potential pathways between occupations based on shared competencies. A key advantage of this
approach is its focus on identifying potential mobility opportunities based on skill relatedness,
providing insights into the set of occupations that workers might feasibly transition into if they
possess the relevant skills (Neffke & Henning, 2013). However, skill-based networks can only explain
part of the mobility structure and have an ex-ante nature, meaning they do not account for realized
choices made by workers and firms in the labor market. Therefore our study focuses on the observed
transition network, which reflects actual labor market flows based on realized worker movements
and goes beyond a skill-based network, revealing structural patterns that are not accounted for
by skill similarity alone. This choice provides a more empirical, agnostic perspective, capturing
the dynamic interplay between worker preferences, employer demands, wage offers and economic
conditions, which shapes the real mobility patterns observed in the labor market.
3.2 Occupational Communities
Both the occupational transition network (Figure 1) and the occupational transition matrix (Figure
2) reveal a community structure indicating barriers to the free reallocation of workers among jobs.
As expected, workers are most often trapped within an occupational community: on average, 91% of
transitions happen within a given community and only 1 out of 6 occupations per community (on
average 17%) have over 10% of their outgoing transitions to different communities.7
To identify the occupational communities, we utilize the BRIM algorithm (See Appendix D), which is
designed to maximize the modularity of Barber (2007), due to its rapid convergence and its ability to
incorporate interdependence between communities across the network (see Platig, Castaldi, DeMeo,
& Quackenbush, 2016, and Appendix A.2). To quantify the intra-community density compared to
inter-community density of flows we use the same network modularity as in Barber (2007).8
Employing the BRIM algorithm results in 8 communities and a modularity of 0.45. The communities
identified through the maximization of modularity broadly correspond to (1) Blue-collar workers, (2)
Public, Health & Education, (3) Engineers & Executives, (4) Sales & Retail (5) Transport & Logistic
(6) Agriculture, (7) Artist & Creative Work (8) Medical Service (see Appendix D for tables with
exact community membership). Although communities could also be given by the INSEE’s 1-digit
PCS codes, we choose the BRIM communities over the INSEE partition since they have a higher
6See the official website https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/repertoire-operationnel-des-metiers-et
-des-emplois-rome/ .
7We define an occupation with an inter-community transition as one where over 10% of transitions occur outside
its community. If we set the threshold at 5%, this would result in 2 out of 5 occupations per community exhibiting
inter-community transitions.
8Modularity serves as a metric for assessing the clustering of networks or graphs, quantifying the effectiveness of
partitioning a network into distinct communities. Networks exhibiting high modularity contain tightly connected
nodes within communities while showing limited connections between nodes belonging to different communities. The
equation to calculate modularity (see eq. 10) is a bipartite expansion of the modularity proposed by Newman and
Girvan (2004).

The low inter-community mobility represents bottlenecks in occupational flows in the French labor
market (see also Bocquet, 2022). Similarly, Neffke and Henning (2013) also find an inherent
community structure within the occupational transition network for Sweden, suggesting frictional
reallocation. They attribute this phenomenon primarily to the skill-relatedness of different jobs:
individuals are more likely to transition to jobs that require similar skill-sets, whereas different
skill-sets represent a higher barrier to making a given transition thus potentially requiring additional

training for some transitions.
3.3 Stationary Distribution of Occupations
Assuming that the right-stochastic transition matrix Pi,jremains constant (consistent with our
findings), it can be thought of as the transition matrix of a Markov chain, which implies a steady
state distribution of occupational employment shares to which the system converges. The implied
steady state distribution ¯xover the different occupations is given by the eigenvector of Pi,jassociated
with the eigenvalue λ= 1, while the rate of convergence for individual occupations is given by the
eigenvector associated with the second largest eigenvalue.
While the steady-state distribution does not necessarily represent an optimal or desirable outcome
from an economic perspective, it serves as a useful benchmark for understanding the structural
dynamics of the labor market. The steady-state distribution provides a baseline that reflects the
equilibrium implied by the observed transition matrix. It allows us to quantify deviations from
this baseline and identify occupation communities where flows appear constrained or misaligned
with the tendency of the network. By benchmarking against the steady-state distribution, we can
identify patterns of excess or underemployment, informing where interventions might be necessary
to facilitate smoother labor market transitions.
We analyze the implied steady-state distribution for each BRIM community and find that the current
state of the labor market deviates from the implied steady state. This deviation can be explained
by the block structure of the occupational transition matrix due to limited inter-community flows
(see Figure 2).
Figure 2(b) shows the percentage difference between the data and the implied steady state for the
occupation share in each occupation. Deviation of the current distribution from the implied steady
state suggests either a slower convergence rate compared to structural changes or insufficient time
for the system to reach equilibrium. These observations indicate labor market constraints that
impede the system from reaching a steady state. Moreover, the majority of transitions occurs within
communities, which explains the over and under-representation of workers in different communities
in comparison to the occupation’s implied steady state.
Over half of all occupations (223 out of 372 occupations) exhibit deviations of more than 10%
from the steady state distribution. Specifically, 88.1% of occupations classified as Blue-collar
workers, 84.2% of Sales & Retail, and 69.7% of Transport & Logistics occupations experience
excess employment. In contrast, the communities of Engineers & Executives and Public, Health
& Education are underemployed, with 86.1% and 64.0% of their occupations, respectively, having
fewer workers than the steady-state distribution suggests. In other communities, the number of
occupations with excess employment and underemployment are balanced (see Figure 2(b)). The
half-time until convergence of the system to its implied equilibrium is given by the spectral gap
ofPi,j, which yields1
1−λ2≈31 years. Putting this timescale into perspective is challenging, but if
worker reallocation were fast, we would expect an order of magnitude of few years rather than few
decades. For example, Bocquet (2022) finds that the speed of labor market reallocation after an
asymmetric shock is around 1 year. This is because they assumes a new transition matrix due to the
shock and measures transition time using a normalized cumulative impulse response. In contrast, we
assume a stable transition matrix and measure the timescale using the spectral gap between the first
and second eigenvalues of the transition matrix. The timescale of convergence of 31 years suggests

that it is slower than small structural shifts in the labor market, implying that worker reallocation
to the implied steady state in the French labor market tends to be sluggish.
3.4 Entry and Exit from the Occupation Network
Since there is low inter-community mobility within our network, the only other option for entry and
exit from a given community is by entry and exit from the occupational network. Over the period
of 2012-2020, 16.3 million (2.0 million p.a.) individuals entered the occupational network, while 10.9
million (1.4 million p.a.) exited, resulting in a net inflow of 600,000 workers per year on average.
Figure 3 shows the inflow and outflow dynamics for each occupational community from and to
outside of the labor market. The width of link from node itojin Fig. 3 corresponds to the
proportion of people transitioning from itojout of the total number of individuals leaving iand
the total number of individuals transitioning into j.
On average 47.3% of transitioning workers enter an occupational community from outside the
occupational network, while 47.5% of those leaving an occupational community enter a state of
unemployment (see Figure 3). This underscores the substantial influence of unemployment on
inter-community transitions. The prevalence of an interim unemployment phase preceding inter-
community transitions suggests considerable bottlenecks for direct transitions between communities.
We leave the study of the unemployment dynamics to future work, as our sample only includes
observations in the period starting T−1 to the end of T, implying that we cannot ascertain where
those unemployed at the end of Tpotentially re-enter the occupational network in T+ 1.
When separating the occupational network across different age groups, we observe that for individuals
under the age of 30, the number of workers entering the occupational network is 25% greater than
the number of workers exiting, while for workers over 60, the total number of workers exiting exceeds
9
----------------------------------------

[Page 10 of 57]
the number of people entering by 100% (see Appendix C Figure 11). This implies a strong role for
job-entry and retirement exit dynamics across the unemployment transitions. To adjust for these
effects, we note that excluding individuals under the age of 18 entering the occupational network,
and those above the age of 64 leaving the occupational network, the ratio between transitions into
and out of the labor force with the total number of direct occupation-to-occupation transitions
shrinks from 14 .2% to 6 .3%, such that we can safely neglect these dynamics in the present analysis.
4 Identifying Bottlenecks: A Data-driven Taxonomy
The occupational transition network developed in Section 3 shows evidence of a strongly clustered
structure, with a majority of transitions occurring within a community. In this Section we apply
methods from the fitness and complexity literature to develop a taxonomy of occupations, classifying
them either as (i) Hubs, (ii) Condensers, (iii) Diffusers, or (iv) Channels, based on their accessibility
and transferability (Section 4.1). Accessibility (fitness) describes the diversity of occupations from
which a given occupation can be reached, while transferability (inverse complexity) describes the
diversity of occupations that can be reached from a given occupation. We show that the majority of
occupations in the French labor market exhibit a higher accessibility than transferability, resulting
in workers becoming condensed into these occupations, with limited opportunities for transitioning
elsewhere, thus Condenser and Channel occupations emerge as bottleneck occupations. We find that
the accessibility metric correctly identifies bottlenecks as it shows high correlation with betweenness
centrality (4.2). Additionally transferability correlated with closeness centrality showing that entering
high transferability occupation helps workers to diffuse into different communities of the network.
Furthermore, we show that our metrics provide information not otherwise contained in factors such
as skill similarities across occupations (Section 4.3). See Appendices H.1 and H.2 for gender and
age effects. Future research could be directed towards understanding how the pressure originating
from high accessibility but low transferability might, to some extent, explain the occupational
wage-distribution.
4.1 Accessibility and Transferability of Occupations
We quantify the accessibility and transferability of an occupation by measuring the diversity of
transitions to and from that occupation using economic fitness and complexity metrics that describe
a hierarchy as nested patterns in a system (Tacchella, Cristelli, Caldarelli, Gabrielli, & Pietronero,
2012). Economic fitness and complexity has previously been used to quantify the productivity and
technology composition of economies (Hidalgo & Hausmann, 2009; Tacchella et al., 2012; Zaccaria,
Cristelli, Tacchella, & Pietronero, 2014), with a particular focus on economic and technological
growth and development using patent and export data (Morrison et al., 2017; Sbardella, Perruchas,
Napolitano, Barbieri, & Consoli, 2018; Straccamore, Bruno, Monechi, & Loreto, 2023). Fitness and
complexity have only recently been related to labor context (Aufiero et al., 2024), yet in a different
manner.
The fitness, F(n)
i, of an occupation iis an extensive measure defined as the sum over the complexities
of the occupations jthat lead to the given occupation i. The fitness can be interpreted as an
occupation’s accessibility , quantifying the ease and extent of workers transitioning from other
occupations to occupation i.11The complexity, Q(n)
j, of occupation jindicates the difficulty of
11Note that an occupation is more accessible when it is reached by workers from occupations that have limited

[Page 11 of 57]
transferring from occupation jto other occupations. The inverse complexity 1 /Q(n)
jof an occupation
thus serves as an indicator of the occupational opportunities offered by j, and we refer to it as the
transferability of an occupation.
Following Tacchella et al. (2012), these two metrics are determined as the fixed point solution to

˜Pi,jdenotes the transition probability matrix conditional on a worker making a transition, that
is we exclude self-loops i.e. Tr(˜Pi,j) =P
i˜Pi,i= 0. Note that the fitness of an occupation after
one iteration F(1)
i, is the weighted number of occupations from which individuals transitioned into
occupation i. Meanwhile, the complexity of an occupation after one iteration Q(1)
j, is determined
by the inverse of the weighted count of occupations to which individuals transition starting from
occupation j. It is important to note that these metrics only have an interpretation in relative
terms, but not in absolute terms as there is no unit attached. For a schematic representation see
Figure 12 in Appendix E.
Figure 4(a) shows the distribution of accessibility (y-axis) and transferability (x-axis) for the 371
occupations in the French labor market (defined in Section 3). For the interpretation of accessibility
and transferability we have to focus on relative terms, i.e. the comparison between two occupations.
From Figure 4(a) we note that the accessibility of occupations spans seven orders of magnitude, while
the transferability spans six. The majority of occupations show a high degree of accessibility relative
to their degree of transferability, suggesting that they condense the flow of labor: moving between
these occupations slowly reduces the outside options of the workers. In contrast to this, there is only
a handful of occupations where relative transferability remains high while relative accessibility is also
high. Let us stress again that our analysis focuses solely on an average year-on-year transition matrix
due to data limitations. Specifically, we do not directly observe individuals’ residence times in a
given occupation, which may affect the diversity of outside options (transferability) of the occupation,
thus potentially affecting the dispersion of transferability and accessibility of the occupational space.
To study this phenomena of condensation, and identify associated bottlenecks in labor reallocation,
we propose a taxonomy that classifies occupations into four groups (see Figure 4(b)):
•Hubs are characterized by a high transferability and accessibility. These occupations are
broadly accessible to individuals from many occupations while also providing access to a
variety of other occupations and often do not require specialized training or education. For
example, sellers of cultural goods (554G).
options for transition. Thus, an occupation accessible to a wide range of other occupations contributes less to the
transferability of that occupation. Instead, higher accessibility is associated with occupations that are predominantly
transitioned into by workers from other occupations without dispersing elsewhere.
12The initialization is done via ˜F(0)
i= 1∀iand ˜Q(0)
j= 1∀j. We use 200 iterations and confirm that that the
algorithm converges (the fixed point solution is reached).

lines denote the mean-shift clustering boundaries at ΘA= 0.0031 and ΘT= 49.9. The histograms show the
distribution along the accessibility (horizontal) and transferability (vertical) dimensions. (b) Proposal of a
new taxonomy based on the degree of accessibility and transferability of an occupation into four categories.
The arrows schematically represent the potential number of incoming and outgoing transitions for the different
categories.
•Condensers are characterized by a high accessibility but low transferability. While accessible
from a broad range of occupations, these occupations allow for transitions only to a few other
occupations, thus funnelling individuals, e.g. care givers (526A).
•Diffusers are characterized by a low accessibility but high transferability. As the inverse of the
Condenser, these occupations are hard to reach, often due to specialized training, but exhibit
a diversity of opportunities, such as officers and technical flight managers of the merchant
navy (389C).
•Channels are characterized by both a low accessibility and a low transferability, representing
occupations with only a few occupations to transition from and into. For example, skilled
operators on welding machines (623D).
The classification of occupations into this taxonomy depends on two thresholds, ΘAand ΘT, that
separate the low and high regimes for the accessibility and transferability of occupations.13Figure
4(a) shows that the defined taxonomy clusters are well partitioned in the data of the French labor
market.14Appendix F provides a comprehensive table of occupations within each cluster.
The cluster of Condenser occupations contains the largest number of occupations (348 out of 371),
13Thresholds are determined by a mean-shift clustering algorithm (Comaniciu & Meer, 2002). Specifically, we use
the MeanShift implementation from the scikit-learn package in Python with a bandwidth of 3 (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
To ensure robustness, we employed both spectral clustering and k-means clustering (for each dimension separately),
which resulted in similar threshold values (Pedregosa et al., 2011).
14We perform a significance testing with a random network, preserving both in- and out-degree distributions as
in the labor market, to confirm that the cluster sizes of the French labor market are significant. This suggests that
the findings are intricacies specific to the labor market’s flows, and not merely due to the distribution of in- and
out-degrees of occupations.

describing 94% of the total person-year datums in the dataset and 94% of estimated total wages in
2020, thus indicating the economic significance of this phenomenon.15The categories of Channel
(8 occupations), Hub (8 occupations), and Diffusers (7 occupations) make up the remaining set of
occupations. The large share of condensers could be interpreted as a general trend of specialization:
over the course of a career one specializes in terms of experience and skill, therewith inadvertently
reducing the transferability to other occupations. In fact, for 3 out of 5 occupations (59.6%) the
expected transferability of the next occupation is lower than a person’s current occupation. This
aligns with human capital theory, which posits that as workers accumulate specific human capital,
the returns to staying in their current role increase, making transitions less attractive.
However, it is important to note that while human capital theory provides one explanation, our
analysis focuses solely on occupational transitions between the current and subsequent occupations
across all workers, without tracing individual career paths through the labor market.
Figure 5 shows the relation between the number of employees in a given occupation to the occupation’s
accessibility and transferability metrics. As expected, highly accessible occupations have a higher
number of employees given the diversity of occupations, both from within and across communities,
that transfer into these occupations. By contrast, more transferable occupations, i.e. those with a
more diverse set of outside options, are generally smaller. This highlights the condensation effect:
within a community of occupations, there are inroads via highly-accessible occupations, but only a
smaller fraction of individuals transition into highly transferable occupations that allow for a higher
degree of inter-community mobility.
15We compute estimated total wages as the sum over occupations’ median wage multiplied by the number of
employees in the occupation

4.2 Identifying Bottlenecks in the French Labor Market
The implication of the nested and clustered structure of the occupational transition matrix shown in
Section 2 is the existence of bottlenecks, that is, there being only a few occupations that have a high
share of inter-community transitions as compared to intra-community transitions. The accessibility
of an occupation captures this particular phenomenon. Figure 6(a) shows the occupational transition
matrix coloured by the degree of accessibility (dark having high accessibility) and split into the 8
BRIM communities (Section 3.2). One can clearly see that, intuitively, those occupations who receive
a higher share of inflow from inter-community transition are also those with a higher accessibility,
thus these occupations represent the handful of entry-points into different occupational communities.
By contrast, those occupations with a low accessibility receive workers almost exclusively from
within their given community (See also Figure 14 in Appendix G). Prior research has used the
betweenness centrality (Freeman, 1977), i.e. the fraction of shortest paths between any two nodes
that pass through a given node, to identify bottlenecks in network structures (see Bocquet, 2022,
for an application to labor markets). Focusing on the condenser occupations, comprising 94% of
the employed workforce, Figure 6(b) shows that our accessibility metric captures the betweenness
centrality quite well, with a significant Rank Correlation of 0.57. Accessibility and betweenness
centrality capture bottlenecks in an ex-post fashion: they consider the diversity of the incoming
transitions, thus identifying the occupations in a community that are the target of workers from
other communities (i.e. they consider incoming and outgoing links). However, this does not isolate
the ex-ante perspective of the worker: what can they reach from a given occupation. Here we

capture this additional information through the transferability metric, i.e. we can not only identify
bottlenecks from the perspective of where workers arrive in T(accessibility), but also from the
perspective of where workers start in T−1 (transferability).
Figure 7(a) shows the occupational transition matrix colour-coded by the transferability of a given
occupation. The figure shows that it is those occupations with a high transferability that have
a higher dispersion in possible destinations, both within and across communities. As with high-
accessibility occupations, there are only a few occupations per community that show a high degree
of transferability, and, as highlighted in Section 4.1, high-transferability occupations tend to have a
smaller number of employees. Furthermore, higher transferability is positively correlated (although
in weaker fashion than for accessibility) with the ratio of inter- to intra-community transitions (see
Figure 14 in Appendix G). Thus, occupations with high transferability are more likely to facilitate
transitions between communities, serving as exit points to other communities. The consequence
of this being that these occupations reflect the here-presented definition of bottlenecks: they limit
the degree to which there is free mobility between occupations. This is not intended to suggest
any occupation should be able to transition to any other occupation (e.g. in the sense that some
occupations require specialized training), but rather that this is, empirically, the identified structure
of the labor market.

correlation of 0.27 observed between the product of inter- and intra-community of skill similarity and accessibility
and a significant and positive rank correlation of 0.19 between the ratio of inter- and intra-community skill
similarity and the degree of transferability for each occupation.
4.3 Skill Effects on Accessibility and Transferability
To get a better understanding of the drivers behind accessibility and transferability we consider the
skills required in each occupation. Skill-similarity between different occupations has been shown
to be a significant influence on occupational transitions (Gathmann & Sch¨ onberg, 2010; Neffke
& Henning, 2013) and has been used to reconstruct labor flow networks (del Rio-Chanona et al.,
2021). We compute the skill-similarity between two occupations as the cosine similarity between
their respective binary skill-vectors (derived from the ROME classification system) with 1 (resp.
0) for every skill present (resp. absent) in a given occupation. Occupations with low average skill
similarity tend to be highly specialized, such as Tax, Treasury, Customs controllers (451C), while
occupations with high average skill similarity include occupations such as Childcare workers (431C).
Based on the skill similarity, we compute the average similarity of an occupation i to occupations
in its own community dIntra,iand all occupations in all other communities dInter,i(See Appendix
A.1 eq. 9). From this we can construct two Inter- & Intra- community skill similarity scores: the
product dp=dIntra·dInter, and ratio dr=dIntra/dInter. Thus occupations with a high inter and
intra-community similarity score highly, while those with only unique skills have a low score.
Finally, Figure 8 shows the relationship between the accessibility and the product of inter-intra
skill similarity, dp(a) and the relationship between the transferability and the ratio dr(b). In line
with the discussion of Section 4.2, occupations with a higher accessibility score show evidence of
a higher overall skill-similarity, as signified by the significantly positive rank correlation. Thus,
16
----------------------------------------

[Page 17 of 57]
occupations from outside a given community have sufficient overlap in skills for workers to transition
into these particular occupations, making them entry-points into new occupational communities.
By contrast, considering the relationship between the ratio of intra-community similarity to inter-
community similarity, we see that the degree of transferability is positively related to the similarity
of skills to occupations outside of the current community, suggesting that the transferability maps
those occupations acting as springboards to inter-community transitions. It is the identification of
the occupation of departure that sets apart our accessibility-transferability approach from simply
considering betweenness centrality as identifiers of bottlenecks.
5 Informing Policy using Accessibility and Transferability
In the previous sections, we have shown that there are several occupations that can act as bottlenecks
between occupational communities, and we can identify these using accessibility and transferability
metrics. These occupations may be part of the reason we observe a significant deviation between
the realized distribution of occupations and the steady state implied by the occupational transition
matrix.16While the steady-state distribution does not necessarily represent an optimal labor market
outcome, it allows us to quantify deviations from this baseline applying labor market interventions.
In this section, we show how to improve the speed of convergence, i.e. to reduce frictions, through
a small rebalancing of the occupational flows. In particular, for a given occupation rebalancing
outgoing flows away from high accessibility and towards high transferability targets leads to faster
convergence towards the implied steady state.
For the occupational transition matrix, the rate of convergence to the steady state is determined by
the second eigenvalue λ217, with a lower eigenvalue indicating a faster rate of convergence. Therefore,
our objective is to minimize ∆ λ2=λ⋆
2−λ2, where λ⋆
2is the second eigenvalue of the transition
matrix following a small perturbation P⋆=P+ϵV. Here Vis aN×Nmatrix indicating the
location of the interventions. Specifically, we consider the simple case where for a chosen occupation
k, we increase the flow to occupation l+in equal magnitude to a decrease of the flow to occupation
l−, thus preserving the normalization of Pi,j. Mathematically, one can write
(V)i,j=

−1, i=l−, j=k
1, i=l+, j=k
0,else(4)
The constant ϵ≪1 gives the size of the intervention, which is assumed to be small so as to keep fixed
the implied steady state distribution and the distributions of the accessibility and transferability
metrics. We consider here the case of ϵ= 0.01, whose natural interpretation is that we reallocate
1% of the outgoing labor flows for occupation k.18
16We here explicitly do not make a statement about whether the implied steady state is desirable.
17Note that the rate of convergence is determined by the spectral gap between the first and second eigenvalues.
Since the transition probability matrix is stochastic, the first eigenvalue is λ1= 1.
18To assess the effects of the implemented strategies on these metrics, we compute the rank correlation between the
metrics of the original and perturbed networks. The transferability metrics show a significant average rank correlation
of 0.961, while the accessibility metrics exhibit a significant average rank correlation of 0.975 across all policies. These
findings indicate that even with minor perturbations, the relative values of the accessibility and transferability metrics
remain stable. Furthermore, the mean absolute percentage difference between the steady states of the perturbed
matrices and the unperturbed matrix is below 10−4.
17
----------------------------------------

[Page 18 of 57]
Using matrix perturbation theory, the first-order change in the second eigenvalue can be approximated
by:19
∆λ2=⃗ vT
2V ⃗ v2= (⃗ vT
2)k·((⃗ v2)l+−(⃗ v2)l−), (5)
where we have used the second eigenvector, ⃗ v2, of the unperturbed transition matrix (see Appendix I).
The second eigenvector ⃗ v2describes the slowest mode by which the system approaches its stationary
distribution. States with large magnitudes, |(⃗ v2)i|→1, dominate the system’s slow dynamics, as
they correspond to states with the highest contribution to this relaxation mode. Sign differences
in the entries indicate partitioning of states, as they represent opposite directions in the evolution
of the system’s slow mode, with states in different partitions exhibiting divergent behavior as the
system converges to equilibrium.
If the value of the eigenvector of the target occupation, ( ⃗ v2)k, has a different sign than the difference
in eigenvector values of the source and destination occupations, (( ⃗ v2)l+−(⃗ v2)l−), the change in
second eigenvalue, ∆ λ2, is negative:
∆λ2<0 if(
(⃗ v2)l+>(⃗ v2)l−∧(⃗ v2)k<0
(⃗ v2)l+<(⃗ v2)l−∧(⃗ v2)k>0(6)

eigenvector value difference between the destination and source occupation ( ⃗ v2)l+−(⃗ v2)l−against the eigenvector

∆λ2. (b) Scatter plot showing the relation between log-difference of source and target occupation in transferability

19Note that, to apply first-order matrix perturbation, the matrix must be symmetric. The occupational transition
matrix has a symmetry value of||S||F−||A||F
||S||F+||A||F= 0.9, where P=P+PT
2+P−PT
2=S+A. This indicates that
the occupational transition matrix is almost symmetric. Furthermore, our numerical results demonstrate that the
predictions from first-order perturbation theory align well with the numerical findings (see Figure 9(a) and Appendix
I, Figure 17).
18
----------------------------------------

[Page 19 of 57]
Figure 9(a) shows the distribution of ( ⃗ v2)kversus ( ⃗ v2)l+<(⃗ v2)l−and the consequent distribution
of eigenvalue changes ∆ λ2. Positive and negative changes in the adjustment speed ∆ λ2align
with calculated regimes (see eq. 6). While the bulk of the distribution is concentrated around
0, there are several significant outliers in the ( ⃗ v2)l+<(⃗ v2)l−∧(⃗ v2)k>0 quadrant, hinting at
room for policy interventions to improve labor reallocation. Improvements in adjustment speed
(measured by ∆ λ2) can be achieved by considering accessibility and transferability metrics. Figure
9(b) illustrates the relationship between the log difference in accessibility and transferability metrics
of the flow-increase occupation l+and the flow-decrease occupation l−on, along with the difference
in the second eigenvalue, ∆ λ2. Each point represents a policy that constitutes a perturbation Vfor
all possible combinations of target kand destination l+occupation.20The eigenvalue difference
is more likely to be negative when the accessibility of the flow-increase occupation is lower than
that of the flow-decrease occupation, with a significant correlation coefficient of 0.26 (Appendix I).
Simultaneously, we find that ∆ λ2<0 when the transferability of the destination occupation is higher
than the transferability of the source occupation, with a significant correlation coefficient of -0.13
(Appendix I). In terms of our taxonomy, this implies an improvement in the speed of convergence to
the implied steady state when we shift the target of outgoing individuals to diffuser occupations
in place of condenser occupations. Practically, this implies fewer individuals transitioning into
already large occupations (see Section 4.1) with a low transferability and limited further mobility.
For example, increasing the flow from “Executives in charge of economic, financial and commercial
studies (372A)” to “Banking Operations Executives (376B)”, while reducing the flow to “IT project
managers, IT managers (388C)”, has a strongly positive impact on the convergence speed.
Historically, the French state’s labor market policies have focused on on-the-job training together
with technical and vocational education (Gazier, 2019), which links to the latter objective: increasing
the transferability of currently low-transferability occupations. While we do not focus here on
thehowof implementing labor market policy, the above results present an intuition about which
occupations to target with policy, presenting a set of channels that may optimally reduce frictions
under the assumption that the implied steady state is indeed a desirable target. At this point,
we should however also note that while we categorize different occupations by their accessibility
and transferability, our dataset does not distinguish between the supply (unemployed and their
characteristics) and the demand (vacancies) drivers of the transition rates between occupations.
Nonetheless, integrating information with accessibility and transferability measures can enhance the
effectiveness of a policy aimed at alleviating bottlenecks in the labor market.
6 Conclusion
In this study, we analyzed the labor flow network of all economically active workers in the French
labor market using micro-data from French employers (BTS-POSTES). Here the observed flows
represent realized transitions within the labor market, as opposed to potential transitions based on
skill similarity between occupations. Realized transitions provide a more accurate reflection of the
complex dynamics emerging from the interaction of workers’ preferences, employers’ hiring decisions,
and the prevailing economic conditions. While skill-based networks can help map potential pathways
based on related skills, our findings reveal that these predicted transitions only partially overlap with

is applied. With this, the target and destination occupations are given. The source occupation is then chosen at
random from existing links of the target occupation kwith a flow greater than epsilon, ensuring that Pi,j≥0∀i, j.

observed flows. The observed transition network, therefore, provides a richer empirical perspective,
capturing structural constraints and revealing patterns of mobility that extend beyond what can
be inferred from skill similarity alone. We demonstrated the presence of significant constraints
in the labor market evidenced by strong communities and a lack of inter-community transitions,
hindering reallocation of workers (Section 3). We then employed a quantitative method to assess the
accessibility and transferability of occupations, using an economic fitness and complexity framework,
to identify precise bottlenecks in the labor market (Section 4). We showed that the emergence of
bottlenecks can be explained by a condensation effect due to occupations with high accessibility
but low transferability, that is in line with the principles of human capital theory, where workers’
accumulation of occupation-specific skills reduces their incentives to transition to other roles. Finally,
in Section 5, we introduced a quantitative approach with the aim of evaluating policy consequences
using the rate of convergence to the stationary distribution, that might aid policymakers in assessing
potential policy initiatives.
While our approach provides valuable insights into the structure of the labor market, it also has
certain limitations. The analysis relies on year-to-year snapshots of transitions without longitudinal
panel data to capture the full trajectory of workers over time. This could introduce potential
biases, as residence times within different occupations vary, which could slightly influence the
degree of transferability of an occupation. Future research with panel data could extend this work
by analyzing the time-dependent condensation effect of individual workers transitioning to more
specialized occupations, and link this to labor market outcomes such as lifetime earnings and wage
progressions. Additionally, it would be valuable to explore whether our metrics could be used to
explain wage differences in occupations as a mismatch between transferability and accessibility
affecting workers’ and firms’ bargaining power.

A Methods & Data
A.1 Skill Data and the ROME Classification
In addition to the annual declaration of social data, we utilize occupational skill data, specifically
the Operational Directory of Trades and Jobs (R´ epertoire Op´ erationnel des M´ etiers et des Emplois,
ROME). This directory, created as a reference system by the French Employment Center (Pˆ ole
emploi), categorizes occupations based on their skills and professional fields. The dataset encompasses
skills ranging from know-how and hard skills to soft skills for over a thousand occupation labels. We
convert these skills into vectors of approximately 800 dimensions, where each entry represents the
extent to which a given skill is associated with that occupation. However, the ROME occupation
classification comprises over 5000 occupations and differs from the 4-digit occupation classification
PCS. Consequently, the mapping from ROME classification to PCS classification is not a one-to-one
correspondence. In cases where a single PCS code is corresponds to multiple ROME occupations,
the skill vector for that PCS occupation is calculated as the element-wise average of the skill vectors
associated with the corresponding ROME occupations. Finally, as a distance metric between two
PCS codes, we use a simple cosine similarity of the skill vectors for each occupation.
di,j=Si·Sj
∥Si∥∥Sj∥(7)
where Skare the skill vectors of the PCS codes. In Section 4.3, we use the ratio and product
of inter- and intra-community skill similarities, dIntra anddInter. For a given occupation i, this
metric calculates the average skill similarity to all occupations j within (intra) and outside (inter)
occupation i’s community.
dIntra,i=⟨˜di,j⟩ci=cj (8)
dInter,i=⟨˜di,j⟩ci̸=cj (9)
where ciis the BRIM community of occupation i.
A.2 Brim Algorithm
To identify the communities within our bipartite network, we employ the modularity maximization
algorithm BRIM, which seeks to maximize the Barber modularity defined as follows (Barber, 2007;
Platig et al., 2016):
Q=1
ENRX
i=1NCX
α=1(Mi,α−Pi,α)δ(ai, aα) (10)
with the total number of links E,Mi,αthe biadjacency matrix, Pi,αthe probability that a link
exists by chance and the membership variable that defines the block that node i belongs to ai. This
specific algorithm proved effective for the paper’s objectives, particularly due to its consideration
of the interdependence between communities in the different parts of the network, resulting in a
well-defined partition for the labor flow network. Nonetheless, we also tested a partitioning by the
BiLouvain algorithm to validate the robustness of our findings.
A.3 Nestedness
In this study, we employ the NODF (Nestedness based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill) measure, a
widely utilized metric for nestedness analysis developed by Almeida-Neto, Guimaraes, Guimaraes Jr,
24
----------------------------------------

[Page 25 of 57]
Loyola, and Ulrich (2008). This metric is chosen due to its relevance to a structural property in
complex networks, wherein the neighborhood of a given node is a subset of the neighborhoods of
better-connected nodes. In the context of the fitness and complexity metric, our focus lies in ranking
occupations based on their transferability and accessibility. It has been demonstrated that various
social systems exhibit this hierarchical behavior in their rankings (Laudati, Mariani, Pietronero,
& Zaccaria, 2023; Ren, Zeng, & Zhang, 2020), and the nestedness metric serves as a quantitative
measure for this phenomenon. The values span a range from 0 to 100, where 100 represents a
fully nested network, and 0 reflects a non-nested pattern resembling a checkerboard like structure.
This metric is based on two key properties: decreasing fill and paired overlap. Paired overlap is
essentially the percentage of 1’s in a given column (or row) that align with identical positions in
another column. Then, NODF is the average of all paired values across columns (n) and rows (m):
NODF =PNpaired
n(n−1)
2
+
m(m−1)
2 (11)
In the realm of fitness and complexity research, where scholars examine import/export matrices of
countries and their products, diverse values of the NODF measure are observed. For instance, the
world trade network for Bovine exhibits a NODF value of 0 .12, the typewriter network has a NODF
value of 0 .35, and on a company-product level, the NODF value is also 0 .12 (Laudati et al., 2023;
Ren et al., 2020).
B Temporal Stability
The structure of the occupation transitions in France has remained stable over the sample period of
2012-2020, despite events such as COVID-19. To test temporal stability we focus on link-stability
over time, both in existence and magnitude of the transition rates. This can be captured in a simple
regression comparing the current transition rate to that of 2012 as a baseline year:
Pt
i,j=αi,t+βi,tP2012
i,j+ϵi,t∀t∈ {2013, . . . , 2020}, (12)
such that the hypothesis of temporal stability can be captured by the joint test of H0:αi,T=
0, βi,T= 1. That is, we expect the magnitude of transitions to be the same as 2012 without any
general trend ( αi,T).
Our findings indicate that the coefficient αi,t→0, and the coefficient βi,t→1 remains stable over
time (Figure 10). This stability underscores the persistence of transition probabilities across years
and allows as to combine all observations over the period of 2012-2020.
C Entry and Exit from the Occupation Network
Figure 11 illustrates the proportion of workers transitioning into (green) and out of (red) specific
occupations across different age groups. There is variability in the inflow and outflow across
occupations. In panel (a), which depicts the entire network distribution, occupations like Gendarmes
(532A) or Chief Warrant Officers (452B) exhibit significantly higher inflows than outflows, whereas
Foremen and supervisors in agriculture, forestry (480A) experience higher outflows than inflows.
In Figure 11 (b), displaying distributions only for workers under 30, occupations such as Apprentice
bakers and butchers (683A) show more outflows than inflows, while Non-commissioned military

workers into the labor market, amounting to 2% more inflows. Among the age group below 30, the influx is 25%
higher, while for the age group below 60, outflows exceed inflows by a factor of two.
officers have higher inflows than outflows. Overall, in the under-30 age group the inflow of workers
is 25% higher than the outflow.
Conversely, for workers above 60, the outflow exceeds the inflow by a factor of two. The occupations
with the highest outflow are for example Administrative executives of France Telecom (333D), France
Telecom employees (521B) Qualified metal machining operators (623F).

E Economic Fitness and Complexity
Figure 12 shows a schematic example of transferability (left) and accessibility (right) based on ˜Pi,j.
A black square indicates a link between two occupations, i.e. ˜Pi,j>10−2. In Figure 12 bakers and
pastry cooks exhibit higher transferability than manager (left panel) as they have more opportunities
for transitions. Similarly, the occupation of bakers and pastry cooks is more accessible than the
occupation of a manager, i.e. more different occupations lead to bakers and pastry cooks than to a
manager.
We need to make sure that the fitness and complexity algorithm converges. For the iterative process
to find a fixed point for Accessibility and Transferability, the underlying transition matrix needs to
exhibit a certain nestedness (Tacchella et al., 2012). Ordering the axes of the binary transition matrix
based only on the in- and out-degree of the respective occupation does not reveal a nested structure
(Figure 13 (a)). However, when sorting the x-axis by transferability and the y-axis by accessibility,
an inherent nested structure within the labor market becomes apparent (see Figure 13 (b)). In this
arrangement, the bottom-right corner of the matrix contains on the x-axis occupations characterized
by the highest transferability and on the y-axis occupations with lowest accessibility (see Figure
38
----------------------------------------

[Page 39 of 57]
Figure 13 –Sorted, Transition Probability Matrix. X-axis corresponds to occupations in (T-1) and y-axis
to occupations in (T). (a) Diversification and Ubiquity ordering (b) Accessibility and Transferability ordering
(c) In-Block Accessibility and Transferability ordering. Each Block, detected by the BRIM algorithm (red lines),
has a higher NODF than the raw matrix. The intensity of the coloring corresponds to higher probability flow
from (T-1) to (T).
13 (b)). This nestedness reveals a distinct hierarchy in labor flows, suggesting that occupations
positioned higher on the y-axis are broadly accessible to a diverse array of occupations. Nestedness
can be quantified through the NODF (Nestedness based on Overlap and Decreasing Fill), which
determines the degree to which the neighborhood of a given node is a subset of better-connected
nodes’ neighborhoods. The values range from 0 to 100, where 100 indicates full nestedness, and 0
signifies a non-nested pattern resembling a checkerboard structure. For the French labor market,
theNODF = 10.01, falling within a comparable order of magnitude to other economic systems (Ren
et al., 2020). For instance, in the company-product space, NODF values are around 12 (Laudati et
al., 2023).
Despite comparable high nestedness, the Accessibility-Transferability metrics do not consider the
labor market’s inherent community structure. Subsequently, we evaluate the in-block accessibility
and transferability of the communities given by the BRIM algorithm (see Figure 13 (c) and Section
3.2). As expected, the nestedness within each block exceeds the overall nestedness of the unclustered
transition matrix ( ⟨NODF ⟩= 12 .56). As already found in Section 3.2 most transitions occur
within these communities, but some extend beyond them (see Figure 13 (c)). Transitions outside
the community are mainly associated with occupations having high transferability, suggesting
a bottleneck effect for individuals in low-transferability occupations (Condenser and Channel
occupation) aspiring to transition beyond their community. These findings already suggests a
potential avenue for increasing reallocation speed since one can identify precisely occupations that
cause frictions (see Section 5).
It is reassuring to note that each community, whether defined by the 1-digit PCS code or by the BRIM
algorithm, incorporates Hub occupations. These occupations serve as potential gateways within
each community, facilitating access to desired occupations outside the community. Interestingly, this
method is flexible enough to study the change of transferability and accessibility metrics and the
corresponding clusters over time. When comparing accessibility and transferability metrics across
different transition matrices for various years, it’s important to note that direct value comparison is
not possible since these metrics are relative within each year. Instead, one need to rely on a rank

Figure 15 –Gender Effect on Accessibility and Transferability. Scatter plot depicts the relationship
between Female-to-Male ratio (a) the degree of transferability and (b) the degree of accessibility for each
occupation. Color coding corresponds to the introduced occupation taxonomy. A dashed line serves as a visual
guide and represents the linear fit of the points. There is a significant and negative rank correlation of -0.29
observed between Female-to-Male ratio and transferability and a significant and positive rank correlation of 0.19
between Female-to-Male ratio and accessibility (legend of (a,b)). Panel (c) illustrates the confusion between
taxonomy clustering for the labor market within female and male network. Occupations assigned to the same
cluster in both networks are excluded (diagonal elements). Notably, there is a substantial number of occupations
in the Condenser cluster for male network that are distributed across the Hubs, Diffuser, and Channels clusters
for the female network. This indicates a broader dispersion in the accessibility and transferability space for the
female network.
The female-to-male ratio of employees in an occupation has a significant influence on the accessibility
and transferability metrics. The rank correlation between transferability and the gender ratio is
at -0.29, while for accessibility the correlation is 0.19, both with significant p-values of <10−3(see
Figure 15 (a,b)). Occupations with lower transferability tend to exhibit higher female-to-male ratios,
whereas those with higher accessibility tend to have higher female-to-male ratios. This discrepancy
between the transferability and accessibility and gender ratios in different occupations is captured
by our metrics.
To assess gender differences, we construct separate male and female networks from the data and
independently calculate their accessibility and transferability metrics. Figure 15 (c) shows that
within the female network, 52 occupations that are classified as Condensers in the male network are
classified as Hub, Diffuser, and Channel in the female network. This means that the dispersion of
transferability and accessibility of occupations is much wider, and the female labor flow network
reveals more occupations with fewer transitions between them and more occupations that are
challenging to access. Since only the relative difference between the accessibility and transferability
matters, when it comes to reallocating workers in response to shocks, female workers face higher
constraints than male workers.
Using the accessibility transferability metric, we can identify exactly the bottleneck occupations in
53
----------------------------------------

[Page 54 of 57]
the female labor flow network. In the male network, occupations like IT project managers (388C),
Computer operating employees (544A), and Hospitality Staff in Educational Institutions have very
low transferability (525B). Occupations in the Channel category with the least accessibility include
salaried hairdressers (562B), visual artists (354A), and babysitters (563A), which, on average, have
a higher proportion of female workers than male.
Conversely, in the female network, Secretaries (461C), Qualified personnel from legal departments
(543E), and Unskilled employees of accounting and financial services (543C) have the lowest transfer-
ability (see Figure 15). Occupations with the lowest accessibility in the Channel category are male
dominated, including sea fishers and aquaculture workers (692A), Transport Controllers (546A),
and Qualified drivers of guided transport vehicles (654B).

Figure 16 –Age Effect on Accessibility and Transferability. Scatter plot depicts the relationship between
age median and (a) the degree of transferability and (b) the degree of accessibility for each occupation. Color
coding corresponds to the introduced occupation taxonomy. A dashed line serves as a visual guide and represents
the linear fit of the points. There is no significant rank correlation observed between age and transferability nor
between age and accessibility (legend of (a,b)). Panel (c) illustrates the confusion between taxonomy clustering
for the labor market within the age groups below 30 and above 60. Occupations assigned to the same cluster
in both networks are excluded (diagonal elements). Notably, there is a substantial number of occupations in
the Condenser cluster for the age group above 60 that are distributed across the Hubs, Diffuser, and Channels
clusters for the age group below 30. This indicates a broader dispersion in the accessibility and transferability
space for the age group below 30.
Figures 16 (a) and (b), show the relationship between the median age of an occupation and its (a)
degree of transferability and (b) accessibility. There is no significant rank correlation between the
median age and either transferability or accessibility. This indicates that our metrics for accessibility
and transferability are note correlated to age-related effects.
To investigate the impact of age on our findings, we construct a labor flow network separately for
workers below the age of 30 who are typically still in the learning or training phase for specific
occupations and for workers above 60 who might experience seniority effects (Eurostat, 2018).
When analyzing transitions separately for workers under 30 and those over 60, we can discover on
54
----------------------------------------

[Page 55 of 57]
a single occupational level the presence of entry positions and those offering more opportunities
for older workers. Figure 16 (c), shows the confusion matrix illustrating the classification of the
same occupations across different age groups21. Fifty occupations are classified differently between
the age groups. The majority of shifts in classification occur from the ”Condenser” category in the
over-60 network to other categories in the under-30 network. Suggesting a more dispersed spectrum
of accessibility and transferability for the under-30 age group, which indicates a higher prevalence of
occupations that are less accessible but possess a greater degree of transferability.
If an occupation in the network of workers below 30 is in the Hub (Condenser) category and switches
to a Diffuser position (Channel) in the network above 60, it suggests higher accessibility to younger
workers, indicating potential entry-level roles. Examples include Unskilled employees of accounting
or financial services (543C) or Employed eyewear opticians and audioprosthetists (433B).
Conversely, if transferability of an occupation increases with age, leading to a shift from Condenser
(Channel) to Hub (Diffuser), it suggests that opportunities for specific occupations tend to expand
with age. Examples of such jobs include Qualified employees of accounting or financial services
(543B) and Sellers of beauty, luxury and optical products (554F) (see Figure 16). For the first
occupation, one might argue that specific skills necessitate time for acquisition, whereas in the latter
occupation, acquiring skills like selling products to individuals and cultivating a network of trusted
customers could create new opportunities for occupational transitions.
I Policy Evaluation with Matrix Perturbation
The occupational transition matrix Pis a right stochastic matrix where each entry
Pi,j=Pr(Xi=i|Xj=j) (13)
corresponds to the probability of transitioning to occupation j, given an occupation i, withP
jPi,j=
1. Then there exists one eigenvalue λ1= 1 corresponding to an eigenvector ⃗ v1=⃗ πthat is the
stationary distribution ⃗ πfor a markov process of N→ ∞ steps.
LetPbe a symmetric matrix with eigenvectors ⃗ viandλi, then
P⃗ vi=λi⃗ vi (14)
Now let us consider a perturbation ϵV, then

with this
(P+ϵV)(⃗ v2+ϵ⃗ v) = (λ2+ϵλ)(⃗ v2+ϵ⃗ v) (18)
21We exclude diagonal elements, representing occupations classified the same in both age groups.

THE EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGES ON LOW-WAGE JOBS∗

We estimate the effect of minimum wages on low-wage jobs using 138 promi-
nent state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016 in the United
States using a difference-in-differences approach. We ﬁrst estimate the effect of
the minimum wage increase on employment changes by wage bins throughout the
hourly wage distribution. We then focus on the bottom part of the wage distribu-
tion and compare the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new
minimum wage to the missing jobs paying below it to infer the employment effect.
We ﬁnd that the overall number of low-wage jobs remained essentially unchanged
over the ﬁve years following the increase. At the same time, the direct effect of
the minimum wage on average earnings was ampliﬁed by modest wage spillovers
at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates by detailed demographic
groups show that the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution
at the bottom of the wage distribution. We also ﬁnd no evidence of disemployment
when we consider higher levels of minimum wages. However, we do ﬁnd some evi-
dence of reduced employment in tradeable sectors. We also show how decomposing
the overall employment effect by wage bins allows a transparent way of assessing
the plausibility of estimates. JEL Codes: J23, J38, J88.

I. I NTRODUCTION
Minimum wage policies have featured prominently in recent
policy debates in the United States at the federal, state, and lo-
cal levels. California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and
New York have passed legislation to eventually increase minimum
wages to $15/hour, and at least ﬁve other states are on paths to
raise their minimum wages to $12 or more. Over a dozen cities
have instituted city-wide minimum wages during the past three
years, typically by substantial amounts above state and federal
standards. Underlying much of the policy debate is the central
question: what is the overall effect of minimum wages on low-
wage jobs?
Even though nearly three decades have passed since the ad-
vent of “new minimum wage research” (see, e.g., Card and Krueger
1995 ;Neumark and Wascher 2008 ), there is surprisingly little
research on the effect of the policy on overall employment. This
shortcoming is particularly acute given the importance policy
makers place on understanding overall responses. For example, in
its attempt to arrive at such an estimate, the 2014 Congressional
Budget Ofﬁce (CBO) report noted the paucity of relevant research
and then used estimates for teen minimum wage elasticities to
extrapolate the total impact on low-wage jobs.
In this article we use a difference-in-differences design to
estimate the impact of minimum wage increases on the entire fre-
quency distribution of wages and subsequently focus on changes
at the bottom of the distribution to estimate the impact on employ-
ment and wages of affected workers. Our approach relies on the
idea that the overall employment and wage effects of the policy
can be inferred from the localized employment changes around the
minimum wage. An increase in the minimum wage will directly
affect jobs that were previously paying below the new minimum
wage. The jobs shifted into compliance create a “bunching” and
show up as “excess jobs” at and slightly above the minimum. The
effect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution fades out and
becomes negligible beyond a certain point. Therefore, the overall
employment and wage effects of the policy can be inferred from
the localized employment changes around the minimum wage. For
instance, we can assess the changes in employment from the dif-
ference between the number of excess jobs at and slightly above
the minimum wage and the number of missing jobs below the
minimum.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGES ON LOW-WAGE JOBS 1407
To identify the effect of the minimum wage on the frequency
distribution of wages, we implement an event study analysis that
exploits 138 prominent state-level minimum wage increases be-
tween 1979 and 2016. We estimate employment changes in each
dollar wage bin relative to the new minimum wage for three years
prior to and ﬁve years after an event. Our empirical approach
therefore disaggregates the total employment effect of the policy
into constituent wage bins, and we use these bin-by-bin estimates
locally around the minimum wage to assess the effect of the policy.
There are several advantages of our disaggregated approach
relative to the more standard approach that estimates the dis-
employment effect using aggregate employment or wage changes
(e.g., Meer and West 2016 ). First, we focus on employment changes
locally around wage levels where minimum wages are likely to
play a role. When only a small fraction of the aggregate workforce
is affected by the minimum wage, such a localized approach is
crucial for uncovering meaningful “ﬁrst-stage” wage effects of the
minimum wage—something that is not possible with the standard
approach except for subgroups like teens. Second, by decompos-
ing the aggregate employment impact by wage bins, we are able
to assess employment changes in the upper tail of the wage dis-
tribution. This can provide an additional falsiﬁcation test, since
large changes in the upper part of the wage distribution are un-
likely to reﬂect a causal effect of the minimum wage. Third, our
localized focus on jobs around the minimum wage gains precision
by ﬁltering out random shocks to jobs in the upper part of the
wage distribution.
We use hourly wage data from the 1979–2016 Current Popu-
lation Survey to estimate the effect of the minimum wage by wage
bins. We ﬁnd that an average minimum wage hike led to a large
and signiﬁcant decrease in the number of jobs below the new min-
imum wage in the ﬁve years after implementation. At the same
time, there was clear evidence for the emergence of excess jobs at
or slightly above the minimum wage. However, as expected, we
ﬁnd no indication of any employment changes in the upper part
of the wage distribution—providing further validation to the em-
pirical design. We estimate that the number of excess jobs closely
matched the number of missing jobs: the employment for affected
workers rose by a statistically insigniﬁcant 2.8% (std. err. 2.9%).
Our estimates also allow us to calculate the impact of the policy
on the average wages of affected workers, which rose by around
6.8% (std. err. 1.0%). The signiﬁcant increase in average wages ofDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

affected workers implies an employment elasticity with respect to
own wage (or the labor demand elasticity in a competitive model)
of 0.41 (std. err. 0.43), which rules out elasticities more negative
than−0.45 at the 95% conﬁdence level.
An additional advantage of estimating the effect of the mini-
mum wage on the frequency distribution of wages is that we can
assess the extent to which the direct wage effects of the minimum
wage are ampliﬁed by wage spillovers. We ﬁnd that spillovers ex-
tended up to $3 above the minimum wage and represent around
40% of the overall wage increase from minimum wage changes.
Interestingly, we also ﬁnd that the beneﬁts of wage spillovers
were not equally shared: workers who had a job before the min-
imum wage increase (incumbents) experienced signiﬁcant wage
spillovers, but we do not ﬁnd any evidence of such spillovers for
new entrants. This asymmetry suggests that spillovers may re-
ﬂect relative pay concerns within the ﬁrm ( Dube, Giuliano, and
Leonard 2018 ) and the value of outside options or reservation
wages of nonemployed workers is unlikely to play a key role in
generating wage spillovers (e.g., Flinn 2006 ).
Our estimates are highly robust to a wide variety of ap-
proaches to controlling for time-varying heterogeneity that has
sometimes produced conﬂicting results in the existing literature
(e.g., Allegretto et al. 2017 ;Neumark and Wascher 1992 ). More-
over, the shifts in the missing and excess jobs are strongly related
to the timing of minimum wage change—providing further sup-
port that we are identifying the causal effect of the policy. Both
missing jobs below the new minimum and excess jobs above were
close to zero prior to the minimum wage increase, which sug-
gests that the treatment and the control states were following a
parallel trend. The drop in jobs below the minimum wage is im-
mediate, as is the emergence of excess jobs at or slightly above the
minimum. Over the ﬁve-year post-treatment period, the magni-
tude of the missing jobs below the new minimum wage decreases
only slightly, underscoring the durability of the minimum wage
changes studied here.
To go beyond our overall assessment of the 138 case studies
used for identiﬁcation, we also produce event-by-event estimates
of the minimum wage changes. Although we ﬁnd substantial het-
erogeneity in the bite of the events, the distribution of employment
effects are consistent with a sharp null of zero effect everywhere.
For example, our event-by-event analysis ﬁnds that the esti-
mated missing jobs rose substantially in magnitude with theDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

minimum-to-median wage (Kaitz) index. At the same time, the
number of excess jobs also rose for these events to a nearly iden-
tical extent. As a consequence, there is no relationship between
the employment estimate and the Kaitz index up to around 59%,
conﬁrming that the minimum wage changes in the United States
that we study have yet to reach a level above which signiﬁcant
disemployment effects emerge.
The lack of responses in overall employment might mask
some heterogeneity in response across types of workers. Our lo-
calized approach around the minimum wage can be easily applied
to various subgroups, including those where only a small fraction
of workers are affected by the minimum wage. As a result, we
can provide a more complete picture of how various groups are
affected by the minimum wage.
We examine whether there is a shift from low-skill to high-
skill workers at the bottom of the wage distribution by partitioning
workers into groups based on education and age. Comparing the
number of excess jobs at or above the new minimum wage and
missing jobs below it across age-by-education groups shows no
evidence that low-skilled workers are replaced with high-skilled
workers following a minimum wage increase. We also use demo-
graphics to predict the probability of being exposed to the mini-
mum wage increase, and then assign workers to high, medium,
and low probability groups along the lines of Card and Krueger
(1995) . While there is considerable variation in the bite of the pol-
icy, the employment effects in these subgroups are mostly close to
zero and not statistically signiﬁcant. The similar responses across
demographic groups also suggest that the beneﬁt of minimum
wage policies were shared broadly.
Our approach also allows us to provide a more comprehen-
sive picture on responses across various sectors of the economy.
We show that the minimum wage is likely to have a negative ef-
fect on employment in the tradeable sector, and in manufacturing
in particular—with an employment elasticity with respect to own
wage of around −1.4—although the estimates are imprecise. At
the same time, the effect of the minimum wage is close to 0 in
nontradeable sectors (such as restaurants or retail), which em-
ploy most minimum wage workers in the United States today.
This evidence suggests that the industry composition of the local
economy is likely to play an important role in determining the dis-
employment effect of the minimum wage ( Harasztosi and Lindner
forthcoming ).Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

1410 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
This article makes several contributions to the existing liter-
ature on minimum wages. First, it relates to the large and con-
troversial literature on the employment effects of the minimum
wage. The debate has often been concentrated on the impact
on teen employment ( Card 1992 ;Neumark and Wascher 1992 ;
Neumark, Salas, and Waschler 2014 ;Allegretto et al. 2017 ), work-
ers in speciﬁc sectors ( Lester 1964 ;Katz and Krueger 1992 ;Card
and Krueger 1994 ;Dube, Lester, and Reich 2010 ), or workers earn-
ing low wages prior to the minimum wage increase ( Currie and
Fallick 1996 ;Abowd et al. 2000 ;Clemens and Wither 2019 ), while
the evidence on the impact on overall employment is scant. By
disaggregating the standard difference-in-differences estimates
by wage bins, we can identify the effects of the minimum wage
on overall employment and obtain meaningful ﬁrst-stage wage
effects at the same time.
A notable exception studying overall employment changes is
Meer and West (2016) , who examine the relationship between
aggregate employment at the state level and minimum wage
changes without assessing the wage effects. Meer and West (2016)
ﬁnd a large negative employment estimate using variants of the
classic two-way ﬁxed effects regression on log minimum wage.
To highlight the importance of disaggregating the aggregate em-
ployment effects into wage bins, we calculate the bin-by-bin em-
ployment effects in such a speciﬁcation. This exercise produces a
striking ﬁnding: the speciﬁcations that indicate a large negative
effect on aggregate employment tend to be driven by an unrealisti-
cally large drop in the number of jobs at the upper tail of the wage
distribution, which is unlikely to be a causal effect of the mini-
mum wage. We also provide an explanation for why the classic
two-way ﬁxed effect and our event study approach produce differ-
ent results. We show that the large negative effect on employment
is driven entirely by inclusion of the 1980s and the early 1990s
in the sample—a period with very few minimum wage changes.
However, aggregate employment changes in the 1980s turn out to
be correlated with minimum wage changes in the 2000s. Although
inclusion of the 1980s biases the estimation in the two-way ﬁxed
effect approach, it does not affect our event study approach, which
focuses on employment changes locally around the event window.
It is worth noting that the disagreement on the choice of speciﬁ-
cation for estimating the impact of minimum wages on teen em-
ployment is also driven by these early period confounding shocks
(Neumark, Salas, and Wascher 2014 ;Allegretto et al. 2017 ). WeDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

ﬁnd that in the post-1992 period, there is little evidence of disem-
ployment for teens across any of the standard specﬁcations.
Our article also contributes to the literature on the effect of
the minimum wage on overall wage inequality ( DiNardo, Fortin,
and Lemieux 1996 ;Lee 1999 ;Autor, Manning, and Smith 2016 ).
These papers examine shifts in the wage density and assume away
any possible disemployment effect. In contrast, we focus on the
frequency distribution of wages instead of the wage density, which
allows us to assess the effect on wage inequality and employment
at the same time.1We show that the measured wage spillovers
are not an artifact of disemployment, which would truncate the
wage distribution. In addition, we provide a wide range of evidence
that these spillovers are unlikely to be an artifact of measurement
error. Our spillover estimates are similar to the ﬁndings of Autor,
Manning, and Smith 2016 and Brochu et al. (2017) , and more
limited than those in Lee (1999) .
Finally, our article is also related to the literature that uses
bunching to elicit behavioral responses to public policies ( Kleven
2016 ). At the same time, while most bunching analyses estimate
the counterfactual distribution from purely cross-sectional vari-
ation ( Saez 2010 ;Chetty et al. 2013 ), here we use a difference-
in-differences strategy to construct the counterfactual frequency
distribution of wages and the estimated excess and missing jobs.
The rest of the article is structured as follows. Section II ex-
plains the conceptual approach and the empirical implementa-
tion. Section III presents the main empirical ﬁndings on overall
employment effects, wage spillovers, and heterogenous responses
to the minimum wage. Section IV demonstrates the importance of
assessing employment changes far above the minimum wage and
highlights problems with the classic two-way ﬁxed effects estima-
tion. Section V concludes. Finally, all the Appendix materials can
be found in the Online Appendix .

The ﬁgure shows the effect of the minimum wage on the frequency distribution
of hourly wages. The red dashed line (color version available online) shows the
wage distribution before the introduction of the minimum wage, and the blue solid

some workers are paid below the minimum wage, and the post-treatment distri-
bution starts below the minimum wage. For other workers, the introduction of
the minimum wage produces “missing jobs” ( /Delta1b), as shown by the striped red
shaded area (under the red dashed line) between the origin and MW. These miss-
ing jobs may either reﬂect workers getting a raise, or their jobs being destroyed.

number of missing jobs below MW, given by /triangleb=Emp1[w<MW]
−Emp0[w<MW], reﬂects the bite of the minimum wage.2Here
Emp1[.] and Emp0[.] are the actual and counterfactual frequency
distributions of wages, respectively.
Not all missing jobs below the minimum wage are de-
stroyed. Some or all of the jobs below the minimum wage may be
preserved—with their hourly pay raised to the minimum wage,
creating a spike at MW. Some jobs may be pushed slightly above
the minimum wage to maintain wage hierarchy within the ﬁrm
or because the minimum wage raises the bargaining power of
workers (e.g., Flinn 2011 ). Moreover, a minimum wage increase
might induce low-wage workers to participate in job search, some
of whom may ﬁnd a job above the minimum wage. However, the
ripple effects of the minimum wage are likely to fade out at a cer-
tain point, which we denote WinFigure I . In models with labor
market frictions, wage spillovers also typically fade out, because
workers and ﬁrms in the upper tail of the wage distribution are
operating in different labor market segments (see Van den Berg
and Ridder 1998 ;Engbom and Moser 2017 for examples of such
models).
The neoclassical model suggests that there may be some pos-
itive employment effects in the upper tail of the wage distribution
caused by labor-labor substitution. However, as we discuss in On-
line Appendix B , because minimum wage workers’ share in overall
production is very small (around 2% in the United States), rea-
sonable calibrations of a neoclassical model would suggest very
small upper-tail effects. For example, if we consider an elasticity
of substitution between high- and low-wage workers of around
1.4 based on Katz and Murphy (1992) , and an output demand
elasticity of around 1 based on Aaronson and French (2007) ,t h e
implied upper-tail employment elasticity with respect to the mini-
mum wage would be around 0.006. In Online Appendix Table B.1,
we show that reasonable variations in the key parameters uni-
formly suggest that plausible estimates of minimum wage impact
on upper-tail employment should be very small. Moreover, any
2. When we refer to the “bite” of the minimum wage, or to the extent to which
the minimum wage is “binding,” we mean how effective the minimum wage is
in raising wages at the bottom. Therefore, the bite is a function of (i) how many
workers are earning below the new minimum wage, (ii) how many of those workers
are legally covered by the policy, and (iii) the extent of compliance.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

theoretical upper-tail effects would be positive, so ignoring them
will overstate the net job losses.
We assess the employment effect of the minimum wage on
low-wage workers by summing the missing and excess jobs, /triangleb
+/trianglea, which is equal to the employment change below a wage
threshold W:/triangleb+/trianglea=Emp1[w< W]−Emp0[w< W]. Such an
estimator is similar to the “bunching” method developed in the re-
cent public ﬁnance literature, which uses bunching around points
that feature discontinuities in incentives to elicit behavioral re-
sponses ( Kleven 2016 ). Although the estimation of the overall
effect on low-wage jobs does not require a decomposition by wage
bins relative to the minimum (e.g., into excess and missing jobs),
such a decomposition does help assess the bite of the policy and
exactly how the policy affects jobs and wages at the bottom. For
example, the shape of the excess jobs can tell us about the extent
of wage spillovers.
II.B. Empirical Implementation
The key empirical challenge is to estimate the counterfactual
wage frequency distribution in the absence of a minimum wage
increase. Instead of using either ad hoc functional forms ( Meyer
and Wise 1983 ;Dickens, Machin, and Manning 1998 )o rt h ed i s -
tribution prior to the minimum wage increase ( Harasztosi and
Lindner forthcoming ), we exploit state-level variation in the min-
imum wage and identify the counterfactual distribution using a
difference-in-differences event study design. Our event-based ap-
proach uses a similar framework as Autor, Donohue, and Schwab
(2006) and examines employment changes within an eight-year
window around 138 prominent state-level minimum wage events,
where states increased their minimum wage by at least $0.25,
and where at least 2% of the workers were directly affected by
the increase.3By focusing on employment changes around the
event window, we incompletely capture long-run effects of the
minimum wage. Nevertheless, as we show below, we ﬁnd no evi-
dence of a change in employment up to ﬁve years after the mini-
mum wage hike, and so it strikes us as unlikely that our empirical

for these events, the change in missing jobs, /Delta1b, is identiﬁed only from time-
series variation—as there are no “control states” with a wage ﬂoor lower than the
new minimum wage. However, we show in Online Appendix Table A.4 that our
employment and wage estimates are similar when we include federal events as
well.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

design misses important long-term employment changes. Online
Appendix Table A.6 shows the robustness of estimates to alter-
native window lengths, including allowing for up to a seven-year
post-treatment period.
We estimate the effect of the minimum wage not just on ag-
gregate employment but also on employment in every $0.25 wage
bin. Our basic regression speciﬁcation is the following:
(1)Esjt
Nst=4/summationdisplay
τ=−317/summationdisplay
k=−4ατkIτk

where Esjtis the employment in $0.25 wage bins jin state sand at

tert. The treatment dummy Iτk
sjtequals 1 if the minimum wage was
raised τyears from date tand for the $0.25 wage bins jthat fall
between kand k+1 dollars relative to the new minimum wage.
This deﬁnition implies that τ=0 represents the ﬁrst year follow-
ing the minimum wage increase (i.e., the quarter of treatment and
the subsequent three quarters), and τ=−1 is the year (four quar-
ters) prior to treatment. Moreover, the Iτk
sjttreatment variables are
a function of not only state and time but also the wage bins. For in-
stance, k=0 represents the four $0.25 bins between MW andMW
+$0.99 and k=−1 is a “below” bin with wages paying between
MW−$0.01 and MW−$1.00. Our benchmark speciﬁcation also
controls for state-by-wage-bin and period-by-wage-bin effects, μsj
andρjt. This allows us to control for state-speciﬁc factors in the
earnings distribution and also the nationwide evolution of wage
inequality. Finally, /Omega1sjtinclude controls for small or federal in-
creases, and usjtis the error term.4We cluster our standard errors
by state, the level at which policy is assigned. Our standard errors
therefore account for the possibility that employment changes at
different parts of the wage distribution may be correlated within
a state.
4. Our primary minimum wage events exclude very small increases. To ensure
they do not confound our main effects, we include controls for these small events.
We also separately control for federal minimum wages. In particular, separately
for small events and federal events, we construct a set of six variables by interact-
ing{BELOW ,ABOVE }×{EARLY ,PRE ,POST }.H e r e BELOW and ABOVE are
dummies equal to 1 for all wage bins that are within $4 below and above the new

1416 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
As with any difference-in-differences design our approach
identiﬁes the causal effect of the minimum wage under the
assumption that the entire frequency distribution of wages in
the treated and untreated states would move in parallel in the
absence of the policy change. Although this assumption cannot
be tested directly, we conduct a variety of checks whose results
will be reported below. As is standard, we use the leading terms
to assess preexisting trends. As an added check, when we calcu-
late event-by-event estimates in Section III.C , we test whether
the distribution of leading effects is consistent with a sharp null
of zero effects everywhere.
In addition, since our approach locates the source of the em-
ployment effects within the wage distribution, we can use the
upper-tail employment changes as an added falsiﬁcation test.5
Because large positive or negative changes in jobs paying above,
say, $15 an hour are unlikely to reﬂect the causal effect of the
minimum wage, reporting such employment changes in the up-
per tail can be highly informative about model validity. Moreover,
the potential bias from the confounding factors affecting the up-
per tail can be especially large when only a small fraction of the
workforce is directly affected by the minimum wage (as is true in
the United States). The contribution of these omitted variables
may be sizable compared with the relatively small expected effect
of the minimum wage on aggregate employment. As a result, the
bias arising from shocks to the upper tail can be particularly se-
vere when we are interested in estimating the overall employment
effect of the minimum wage.
There are numerous advantages of decomposing the aggre-
gate employment changes by wage bins. First, such a decompo-
sition allows us to focus on employment changes locally around
the new minimum wage—the part of the wage distribution where
we expect the policy to play a role. This variation is highly infor-
mative, yet rarely exploited. Second, and more importantly, our
localized approach allows us to estimate the effects on overall em-
ployment as well as for subgroups where the standard approaches
often fail to provide meaningful estimates on employment and
wages. When only a small fraction of workers are directly affected
by the minimum wage, the effect on the average wage of such
subgroups will be very small. Without a clear wage effect, it is
5. This idea is similar to Autor, Manning, and Smith (2016) who use unrealis-
tically large spillover effects to validate the empirical model in use.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

not clear how to interpret the size of any employment effect found
for those groups.6Third, the localized focus around the minimum
wage often improves the precision of estimates by ﬁltering out
random shocks to jobs in the upper part of the wage distribution.7
We use the estimated ατkfrom equation (1) to calculate the
change in employment throughout the wage distribution in re-
sponse to the policy. The change in the number of jobs (per capita)

we normalize the excess and missing jobs by the pretreatment

which looks at the wage and employment effects aggregated over the entire wage
distribution, fails to produce positive and statistically signiﬁcant wage effects in
most cases. This indicates that the standard approach fails to capture the program
effect of the minimum wage for these subgroups. At the same time, our estimates
focused on low-wage jobs always produce sizable and signiﬁcant wage effects. The
own-wage elasticity of employment estimated using minimum wage variation is
effectively a Wald-IV estimate; hence the lack of a strong “ﬁrst stage” means
estimates are biased toward the OLS estimate obtained by naively regressing
employment on wages ( Bound, Jaeger, and Baker 1995 ).

minimum wage increase. We refer to this estimate as “event-based
bunching” or EB-bunching estimates to highlight that we are (i)
using an event-based difference-in-differences design and (ii) es-
timating the excess and missing jobs locally around the bunching
in the distribution at the minimum wage.
If we divide /Delta1eby the percentage change in the minimum
wage averaged across our events, % /Delta1MW, we obtain the employ-
ment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage:
%/Delta1Total Employment
%/Delta1MW=/Delta1a+/Delta1b
%/Delta1MW.
We deﬁne the percentage change in affected employment as the
change in employment divided by the (sample average) share of
the workforce earning below the new minimum wage the year
before treatment, b−1:9
%/Delta1Affected Employment =%/Delta1e=/Delta1a+/Delta1b
b−1.
We also use the estimated coefﬁcients to compute the percent-
age change in the average hourly wage for affected workers. We
calculate the average wage by taking the ratio of the total wage bill
collected by workers below the new minimum wage to the number
of such workers. Prior to treatment, it is equal to w−1=wb−1
b−1. Here
the wage bill, wb−1, and the number of workers earning below the
new minimum wage just prior to the increase, b−1, are averages for
the full sample of events. The minimum wage increase causes both
the wage bill and employment to change. The new average wage
in the post-treatment period is equal to w=wb−1+/Delta1wb
b−1+/Delta1e.10Therefore,
9. Notice that we divide by the actual share of the workforce and not by the
change in it. As we pointed out earlier, these two are not the same if there is im-
perfect compliance, imperfect coverage, or measurement error in wages. Although
both divisions are meaningful, dividing by the actual share is the more policy-
relevant elasticity. This is because policy makers can calculate the actual share of
workers at the new minimum wage and use the estimates presented in this article.
However, the change in the jobs below the new minimum wage is only known after
the minimum wage increase, so it cannot be used for a prospective analysis of the
policy’s impact.

cients as follows. Averaging the coefﬁcients over the ﬁve-year post-treatment win-

b−1−1=%/Delta1wb−%/Delta1e

The percentage change in the average wage is obtained by taking
the difference in percentage change in wage bill and employment,
and dividing by the retained employment share. This formula
implicitly assumes the average wage change of those workers ex-
iting or entering due to the policy is the same as the average wage
change of affected workers who remain employed.
Finally, armed with the changes in employment and wages
for affected workers, we estimate the employment elasticity with
respect to own-wage (or the “labor demand elasticity” in a com-
petitive market):
%/Delta1Affected Employment
%/Delta1Affected Wage=1
%/Delta1w/Delta1a+/Delta1b

We calculate the standard errors for this elasticity using the delta
method.
Although our use of wage-bin-by-state-by-quarter data is use-
ful for decomposing the employment changes by bins relative to
the minimum wage, our employment and wage elasticities do
not rely on this binning. To clarify this point, we show results
from a simpler method that estimates a regression using state-
by-quarter data, where the outcomes are the (per capita) number
of jobs or total wage bill under, say, $15/hour, and the event in-
dicators are just by state and quarter. We show below that the
resulting employment and wage estimates (and standard errors)
are very similar when using this simpler method.

calculate quarterly, state-level distributions of hourly wages. For
hourly workers, we use the reported hourly wage, and for other
workers we deﬁne the hourly wage to be their usual weekly earn-
ings divided by usual weekly hours. We do not use any observa-
tions with imputed wage data to minimize the role of measure-
ment error.11There are no reliable imputation data for January
1994 through August 1995, so we exclude this entire period from
our sample. Our available sample of employment counts therefore
spans 1979q1 through 1993q4 and 1995q4 through 2016q4.12
We deﬂate wages to 2016 dollars using the CPI-U-RS and
for a given real hourly wage assign its earner a $0.25 wage bin
wrunning from $0.00 to $30.00.13For each of these 117 wage
bins we collapse the data into quarterly, state-level employment
counts Eswtusing the person-level ORG sampling weights. We
use estimates for state-level population aged 16 and over, Nst,
from the CPS-MORG (which in turn is based on the census), as
the denominator for constructing per capita counts. Our primary
sample includes all wage earners and the entire state population,
but we also explore the heterogeneity of our results using different
subgroups, where the bite of the policy varies.
The aggregate state-quarter-level employment counts from
the CPS are subject to sampling error, which reduces the pre-
cision of our estimates. To address this issue, we benchmark
the CPS aggregate employment-to-population ratio to the im-
plied employment-to-population ratio from the Quarterly Census
11. The NBER CPS merged ORG data are available at
http://www.nber.org/morg/ . Wage imputation status markers in the CPS vary and
are not comparable across time. In general we follow Hirsch and Schumacher
(2004) to deﬁne wage imputations. During 1979–1988 and September 1995–2016,
we deﬁne wage imputations as records with positive BLS allocation values
for hourly wages (for hourly workers) and weekly earnings or hours (for other
workers). For 1989–1993, we deﬁne imputations as observations with missing
or zero “unedited” earnings but positive “edited” earnings (which we also do for
hours worked and hourly wages).
12. In general, there has been an increase in the rate of imputation over
time. However, in Online Appendix Table A.3 and Online Appendix Figure A.2, we
show that minimum wage raises are not systematically related to changes in the
imputation rate. Event study estimates for the effect of minimum wages on the
imputation rate show no substantial or statistically signiﬁcant change three years
before and ﬁve years after the treatment.
13. We assign all wages between $0 and $1 to a single bin and all wages above
$30 to the $30 bin. The resulting 117 wage bins are (0.00, 1.25), [1.25, 1.50), . . . ,

of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which is a near universe of
quarterly employment (but lacks information on hourly wages).
Online Appendix F explains the QCEW benchmarking in detail.
As we discuss below, the QCEW benchmarking has little effect on
our point estimates but substantially increases their statistical
precision.
Our estimation of the change in jobs paying below and above a
new minimum wage requires us to specify minimum wage–
increasing events. For state-level minimum wage levels, we
use the quarterly maximum of the state-level daily minimum
wage series described in Vaghul and Zipperer (2016) .14For the
138 minimum wage events, on average, 8.6% of workers were be-
low the new minimum wage in the year before these events and
the mean real minimum wage increase was 10.1%.15
One concern when using $0.25 bins and CPS data is that some
of the bins may be sparse with very few or no workers. However,
we stress that our employment estimate is based on the sum of
employment changes in 36 cells covering a $9 range [ MW−$4,
MW+$4], summed over at least 4 quarters (typically 20 quar-
ters). As a result, small or zero employment in particular cells is
not a major concern. In each state, there are, on average, around
seven workers each quarter in each of the $0.25 bins between
$5 and $15/hour in our sample.16Since the coefﬁcients for our
event dummies are estimated at a $1-bin-year-state level, on av-
erage, for these we use around 112 individual-level observations
per event. Moreover, when we assess the total employment ef-
fects, we calculate the sum of the $1-bin estimates between $4
below and $4 above the minimum wage, and we consider ﬁve-year
averages. This implies that, on average, we use approximately
5,040 individual worker observations per event. This is a well-
sized sample that allows a reliable estimate of the true counts of
employment for each event. Consistent with this point, we note
14. The minimum wage series is available at https://github.com/
benzipperer/historicalminwage/releases .
15. All minimum wage increases including our events are shown in Online
Appendix Figure A.1
16. Overall, we have 847,314 wage-bin-state-period observations, which we
obtained from 4,694,104 individual-level observations, producing a count of 5.5
workers per $0.25 bin. However, the count per bin is higher in the $5-to-$15/hour
range because the upper-tail wage bins are more sparse. The $5-to-$15/hour range
is the relevant one because it contains the [ MW−$4,MW+$4] windows for all
of our events.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

again that results from our approach are very similar to those
from a simpler method that uses state-by-quarter data and where
the outcomes are the (per capita) number of jobs or total wage bill
under $15/hour.
Another potential concern with the data is that misreport-
ing of wages in the CPS may bias our estimates. If reported wages
contain some measurement error, some workers earning above the
minimum wage will appear to earn below it, which could attenuate
the estimate for /Delta1b. However, this does not affect the consistency
of the estimate for /Delta1a+/Delta1bas long as the minimum wage only
affects reported wages below W. The reason is straightforward.
Assume that 1% of the workforce mistakenly report earning below
the new minimum wage in the post-treatment period. This would
lead our estimate of the missing jobs to be too small in magnitude:
ˆ/Delta1b=/Delta1b+0.01. However, this misreporting would also lead to an
equal reduction in the number of excess jobs above, producing
the estimate ˆ/Delta1a=/Delta1a−0.01; this will be true as long as these
misreported workers are coming from the range [ MW,W), which
is likely to be satisﬁed for a wide variety of classical and non-
classical measurement error processes where the support of the
measurement error is contained in [ MW−W,W−MW ]. There-
fore, the employment estimate ˆ/Delta1a+ˆ/Delta1bis likely to be unaffected
by measurement error in reported wages. We also directly as-
sess how misreported wages in the CPS may affect our results in
Online Appendix E , where we compare the CPS hourly wage dis-
tribution to microaggregated administrative data on hourly wages
from three U.S. states that collect this information. Reassuringly,
the evolution of the number of jobs paying below the minimum
wage, and the number of jobs paying up to $5 above the minimum
wage in the CPS data from these three states match quite well
with their counterparts using administrative data.17
17. In Online Appendix F , we also structurally estimate a model of measure-
ment error in reported wages proposed by Autor, Manning, and Smith (2016) ,a n d
show that the contribution of misreporting error to the overall variance in wages
in the CPS and in administrative data on hourly wages from three states are very
similar. Furthermore, we semiparametrically deconvolve the CPS wage distribu-
tion using the estimated measurement error model and show that our estimates
using this measurement error–corrected distribution are very similar to the base-
line estimates ( Online Appendix Table F.3). In Online Appendix C we implement
our approach using administrative data from Washington and ﬁnd estimates to
be similar when using the CPS. Although each piece of evidence has limitations,
together they suggest that our employment and wage results are not likely to beDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

changes are normalized to pretreatment total employment in the
state. Several points should be noted.
First, there is a clear and signiﬁcant drop in the number of
jobs below the new minimum wage, amounting to 1.8% (std. err.
0.4%) of the total pretreatment employment.18Around3
4of this
reduction occurs in the $1 wage bin just under the new minimum.
Second, there is also a clear and signiﬁcant increase in jobs just
at the new minimum wage (at the $0 wage bin). Third, there is
also a statistically signiﬁcant increase in employment in the wage
bin $3 above the new minimum and modest, statistically insignif-
icant increases in the $1 and $2 bins. This pattern of employment
changes is consistent with limited wage spillovers resulting from
the minimum wage increase, as suggested in Autor, Manning,
and Smith (2016) .19Fourth, the excess jobs between the new min-
imum and $4 above it represents 2.1% (std. err. 0.3%) of the total
pretreatment employment. Fifth, the employment changes in the
upper-tail wage bins, from $5 above the minimum wage to $17 or
more (the ﬁnal bin), are all small and statistically insigniﬁcant—
individually and cumulatively as shown by the red line, which
represents the running sum of employment changes. Finally, it is
worth emphasizing that the drop in employment just below the
new minimum, the equal-sized increase just above it, and the lack
of employment change in the upper tail is exactly what we expect
if employers are complying with the law and adjusting wages but
not employment.
We estimate the employment change by adding the missing
jobs below and excess jobs above the minimum wage: /trianglea+/triangleb.
We divide this change by the jobs below the new minimum wage
(b−1=8.6%) to obtain a change in the affected employment of
18. The discrepancy between the actual number of jobs below the new mini-
mum, which is 8.6% of total pretreatment employment on average, and the change
in the number of jobs below it, which is 1.8% on average, can be explained by the
following factors. First, some of the jobs below the minimum wage (e.g., tipped
workers) are exempted from the minimum wage in most states. Second, there are
often multiple changes in the minimum wage in a relatively short period. In these
cases, the cumulative effect of the various treatments should be considered: when
we adjust for this we ﬁnd the change in the number of jobs below the minimum
rises in magnitude from 1.8% to 2.5%. Third, there is some wage growth even in
the absence of a minimum wage increase, and our event study design controls for
these changes.
19. The $3 above the minimum wage is around the 23rd percentile of the
wage distribution on average. Autor, Manning, and Smith (2016) ﬁnds the wage
spillovers are effectively zero at around the 25th percentile.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

2.8% (std. err. 2.9%), which is positive but statistically insigniﬁ-
cant. We can also divide the employment change /Delta1a+/Delta1bby the
sample-averaged minimum wage increase of 10.1% to calculate
the employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage
of 0.024 (std. err. 0.025). This estimate is statistically insigniﬁ-
cant, and the 95% conﬁdence interval rules out substantial re-
ductions in the aggregate employment, including the baseline
aggregate employment elasticity of −0.074 in Meer and West
(2016) (see their Table 4). The most common minimum wage em-
ployment elasticities are from teens; for example, Neumark and
Wascher (2008) argue that this falls between −0.1 and −0.3, while
Allegretto et al. (2017) argue that it is closer to 0. However, the
directly affected share of teens (43.2%) is much larger than the
workforce overall (8.6%). Therefore, to make our estimates on
overall employment comparable to the estimates for teens we can
multiply our estimate and standard errors by the ratio of the
shares0.432
0.086=5.02. This leads to an affected-share-adjusted 95%
conﬁdence interval of [ −0.13, 0.37], which rules out most of the
−0.1 to −0.3 range.
Second, using the formula in equation (2) , we can also calcu-
late the change in the average wage and the employment elasticity
with respect to own wage (i.e., the labor demand elasticity in the
competitive model). We estimate that the effect of the minimum
wage on average wages is 6.8% (std. err. 1.0%), which is statis-
tically signiﬁcant. The estimate for the elasticity of employment
with respect to own wage is 0.411 (std. err. 0.430). The conﬁdence
intervals rule out any own-wage elasticities more negative than
−0.450 at the 95% conﬁdence level. Such a lower bound rules out
many estimates in the literature that found a negative employ-
ment elasticity (see Online Appendix Figure A.7; also, Neumark
and Wascher (2008) argue that the own-wage employment elas-
ticity can easily be −1 or even −2).
Figure III shows the changes in the missing jobs paying be-
low the new minimum wage ( /Delta1bτ), and the excess jobs paying up
to $4 above the minimum wage ( /Delta1aτ) over annualized event time
using our baseline speciﬁcation. All the estimates are expressed
as changes from event date τ=−1, or the year just prior to treat-
ment, the estimates for which are normalized to 0. There are four
important ﬁndings that we would like to highlight. First, we ﬁnd
a very clear reduction in the jobs paying below the new mini-
mum wage (shown in red dashed line) between the year just prior

jump in excess employment at τ=0, and a substantial portion
of it persists and is statistically signiﬁcant even ﬁve years out.
Fourth, for both the changes in the excess and missing jobs there
is only a slight indication of a preexisting trend prior to treatment.
Theτ=−2 leads are statistically indistinguishable from 0 and
although there is some evidence of changes three years prior to
treatment, the leading effects are very small relative to the post-
treatment effect estimates. Moreover, the slight downward trend
in excess jobs, and the slight upward trend in missing jobs is con-
sistent with a falling value of the real minimum wage prior to
treatment. The sharp jump in both the excess and missing jobs at
τ=0, the lack of substantial pretreatment trends, and the per-
sistent post-treatment gap between the two shares all provide
strong validation of the research design. Online Appendix Figure
A.5 shows analogous time paths for wages and employment show-
ing a sharp and persistent wage effect at τ=0 coupled with little
change in employment over the event window—either before or
after treatment.
1. Robustness Checks. InTable I , we assess the robustness of
the main results to including additional controls for time-varying,
unobserved heterogeneity. This is particularly important because
results in the existing literature are often sensitive to the in-
clusion of various versions of time-varying heterogeneity (e.g.,
Neumark, Salas, and Wascher 2014 ;Allegretto et al. 2017 ).
In column (1) we report the ﬁve-year-averaged post-treatment
estimates for the baseline speciﬁcation shown in Figures II
and III. Columns (2) and (3) add wage-bin-by-state speciﬁc linear
and quadratic time trends, respectively. Note that in the pres-
ence of three pretreatment and ﬁve post-treatment dummies, the
trends are estimated using variation outside of the eight-year
window around the treatment, and thereby are unlikely to be af-
fected by either lagged or anticipation effects. Columns (4)–(6)
allow the wage-bin-period effects to vary by the nine census divi-
sions. Column (6) represents a highly saturated model allowing
for state-speciﬁc quadratic time trends and division-period effects
for each $0.25 wage bin.
Overall, the estimates from the additional speciﬁcations are
fairly similar to the baseline estimate. In all cases, there is a
clear bite of the policy as measured by the reduction in jobs pay-
ing below the minimum, /Delta1b. Consistent with the presence of a
substantial bite, there is a statistically signiﬁcant increase in
real wages of affected workers in all speciﬁcations: these rangeDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

Notes. The table reports the effects of a minimum wage increase based on the event study analysis (see equation (1) ) exploiting 138 state-level minimum wage changes between
1979 and 2016. The table reports ﬁve-year averaged post-treatment estimates on missing jobs up to $4 below the new minimum wage, excess jobs at and up to $5 above it, employment,
and wages. Column (1) shows the benchmark speciﬁcation while columns (2)–(6) explore robustness to bin-state time trends and bin-division-period ﬁ xed effects. Column (7) reports
the simpler methodology estimates where we calculate changes in affected wage and employment by using state-by-quarter data, where the outcomes are the number of jobs or the
total wage bill under $15 per hour. Regressions are weighted by state-quarter aggregated population. Robust standard errors in parentheses are clus tered by state. Signiﬁcance
levels are∗0.10,∗∗0.05,∗∗∗0.01.

total employment. The third row, the percentage change in average wages in the affected bins, (% /Delta1W), is calculated using equation (2) . The fourth row, percentage change in
employment in the affected bins, is calculated by dividing change in employment by jobs below the new minimum wage (/Delta1a+/Delta1b
¯b−1). The ﬁfth row, employment elasticity with respect
to the minimum wage, is calculated as/Delta1a+/Delta1b
%/Delta1MWwhereas the sixth row, employment elasticity with respect to the wage, reports1

between 5.7% and 6.9% with common wage-bin-period effects
(columns (1)–(3)), and between 4.3% and 5.0% with division-
speciﬁc wage-bin-period effects (columns (4)–(6)). In contrast, the
proportionate change in employment for affected workers is never
statistically signiﬁcant, and is numerically smaller than the wage
change, ranging between −1.9% and 3.6% across the eight speci-
ﬁcations. For the most part, the employment estimates are small
or positive; the only exception is column (5) with state-speciﬁc
linear trends and bin-division-speciﬁc period effects. The em-
ployment elasticity with respect to the wage is −0.449 (std. err.
0.574). However, adding quadratic trends to the former speciﬁca-
tion (column (6)) substantially reduces the magnitude of the em-
ployment elasticity with respect to the wage to −0.003 (std. err.
0.455).
Finally, column (7) provides employment and wage estimates
using a state-by-period panel, where we regress either the per
capita wage bill or employment under an absolute wage thresh-
old ( W), and then estimate the change in affected wage and em-
ployment using the same formulae as our baseline.21The esti-
mates and standard errors for affected employment (0.025, std.
err. 0.029) and wage (0.063, std. err. 0.011) are virtually identical
to column (1), clarifying that use of wage bins or choices around
those have no impact on our key estimates. At the same time,
unlike our baseline speciﬁcation, this simpler method using an
absolute wage threshold cannot provide separate estimates for
excess and missing jobs.
Online Appendix Table A.4 shows that our results are robust
to focusing only on the events occurring in the states that do not
allow tip credits; dropping occupations that allows tipping; using
full-time equivalent job counts; restricting the sample to hourly
workers; additionally using federal-level minimum wage changes
for identiﬁcation; using the raw CPS data instead of the QCEW
benchmarked CPS; without using population weights; or focusing
on the post-1992 period. We also show robustness to alternative
event window lengths ( Online Appendix Table A.6), and alterna-
tive values of the upper endpoint of the wage window, W(Online
Appendix Table A.5).

wage in all of our events but one.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

III.A. Heterogenous Responses to the Minimum Wage
We can use our approach focused on low-wage jobs to estimate
the effect of the minimum wage on speciﬁc subgroups.
1. By Demographic Groups. We assess the presence of labor-
labor substitution at the bottom of the wage distribution by
examining employment responses across various demographic
groups.22InTable II we report estimates for workers without
a high school degree, those with high school or less schooling,
women, black or Hispanic individuals, and teens using our base-
line speciﬁcation (see equation (1) ).
As expected, restricting the sample by education and age pro-
duces a larger bite. For example, for those without a high school
degree, the missing jobs estimate, /Delta1b,i s−6.5% while for those
with high school or less schooling it is −3.2%. These estimates
for the missing jobs are, respectively, 261% and 78% larger than
the baseline estimate for the overall population ( −1.8%, from
Table I , column (1)). Nevertheless, the large variation in the miss-
ing jobs across various demographic groups is matched closely by
excess jobs above the new minimum wage.23In all cases, except
for the black or Hispanic group, the excess jobs are larger than
the missing jobs, indicating a positive albeit statistically insignif-
icant employment effect. For black or Hispanic individuals, the
difference between excess and missing jobs is negligible. As a re-
sult, the employment elasticities with respect to own wage range
between −0.086 and 0.570 for the ﬁrst ﬁve demographic groups of
the table. In all cases but one, the elasticities are statistically in-
distinguishable from 0. The sole exception is those without a high
school degree, for whom the employment elasticity with respect to
the wage is 0.475 (std. err. 0.268) which is marginally signiﬁcant
at the ten percent level. The minimum wage elasticity for teens
is 0.125, which is more positive than some of the estimates in the
22. Existing evidence on labor-labor substitution has typically focused on spe-
ciﬁc groups like teens ( Giuliano 2013 ), individual case studies ( Fairris and Bujanda
2008 ), or speciﬁc segments like online labor platforms ( Horton 2018 ).
23. In Online Appendix Figure A.8 we also show that the close match between
excess jobs and missing jobs holds also if we fully partition the workforce into 23
age-education cells.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

literature, though we note that it is not statistically signiﬁcant
given a standard error of 0.134.24
In addition, we examine the effects on groups of workers with
differential probability of being exposed to the minimum wage
changes. To determine the likelihood of exposure, we construct a
prediction model analogous to Card and Krueger (1995) .W eu s e
observations from three years prior to the 138 events that also lie
outside any of the ﬁve-year post-treatment windows and estimate
a linear probability model of having a wage less than 125% of
the statutory minimum wage on a rich set of demographic predic-
tors.25We use the estimated model to obtain predicted probabili-
ties of being exposed to minimum wage increases for all individ-
uals in the sample regardless of their actual employment status.
We then use the predicted probabilities to sort individuals into
three groups: a “high-probability” group that contains individuals
in the top 10% of the predicted probability distribution; a “low-
probability” group that contains workers in the bottom 50% of the
predicted probabilities; and a middle group containing the rest.
As expected, the high-probability group shows a consider-
ably larger bite ( /Delta1b=− 9.4%) than the middle group ( /Delta1b=
−2.0%) and the low-probability group ( /Delta1b=−0.4%). At the same
time, the employment elasticities are very similar across the
24. We note that the teen estimates are unrelated to a focus on low-wage jobs,
since the beneﬁts of focusing on employment changes around the minimum wage
is small for groups where most workers are low-wage ones. In Online Appendix
Table A.10 we show that our event study estimates are close to 0 for teens even
if we use overall teen employment. At the same time, the classic two-way ﬁxed
effect speciﬁcation with log minimum wage (TWFE-logMW) generates a sizable
negative estimate for teens and for overall employment as well. In Section IV
we discuss this discrepancy and argue that the difference between our approach
and TWFE-logMW are driven by how the two empirical models are affected by
employment shocks in the 1980s and early 1990s. Online Appendix Table G.7
shows that in the post-1992 period, there is little divergence in teen minimum wage
elasticities across standard speciﬁcations (including the TWFE-logMW); none of
the speciﬁcations suggest noticeable losses to teen employment, and the elasticities
a r en om o r en e g a t i v et h a n −0.03.
25. We use the same predictors as in Card and Krueger (1995) : all three-way
interactions of nonwhite, gender, and teen indicators; all three-way interactions
of nonwhite, gender, and age 20–25 indicators; an indicator for having less than
high school education; continuous highest grade completed variable; a third-order
polynomial in labor market experience; Hispanic ethnicity indicator; interactions
of the education and experience variables with gender. Cengiz (2018) shows the
predictions using this Card and Krueger model compare favorably with those from
more sophisticated machine learning–based methods.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

probability groups. It is worth mentioning that the most precise
estimate of the own-wage employment elasticity reported in this
article appears in Table II , column (6), where we look only locally
around the minimum wage and also focus on the high-probability
group: the conﬁdence interval rejects any value smaller than
−0.251 and larger than 0.663. Such a conﬁdence interval is
quite narrow and rejects many estimates in the literature—
highlighting the gains from combining the demographic proﬁling
approach of Card and Krueger with the approach based on low-
wage jobs advanced herein. The employment elasticities for the
other groups are similar in magnitude, though less precise.26
Overall, these ﬁndings provide little evidence of heterogene-
ity in the employment effect by skill level; the lack of a reduction
in overall low-wage jobs does not appear to mask a shift in em-
ployment from low-skill to high-skill workers.
2. By Industrial Sectors. Much of the literature has focused
on speciﬁc sectors like restaurants, where the minimum wage is
particularly binding—therefore making it easier to detect a clear
effect on the sectoral wage. In contrast, by focusing on changes
at the bottom of the distribution, our approach can recover em-
ployment and wage responses even in industries where only a
small fraction of workers are directly affected by the minimum
wage increase. This allows us to provide a more comprehensive
assessment of the effect of the policy across a range of industries.
InTable III we report estimates for various sectors in the
economy. We assign workers to tradeable and nontradeable sectors
following Mian and Suﬁ (2014) .27The table shows that the bite of
26. In Online Appendix A we show that if we estimate the impact of the events
on the aggregate wage and employment outcomes for each of the three probability
groups, we can obtain a clear wage effect only for the high-probability group—
capturing only around 36% of all minimum wage workers. This highlights the
value of focusing at the bottom of the wage distribution which allows us to get an
overall estimate for all low-wage workers.
27.Mian and Suﬁ (2014) deﬁne “tradeable” industries as having either the
sum of imports and exports exceeding $10,000 per worker or $500 million total;
their “nontradeable” sector consists of a subset of restaurant and retail indus-
tries; “construction” consists of construction, real estate, or land development–
related industries. We use the list in Mian and Suﬁ (2014) of four-digit NAICS
industries and census industry crosswalks to categorize all the industries in the
CPS for 1992–2016. In our sample the shares of employment are 13%, 14%, 10%,
for tradeable, nontradeable, and construction, respectively. See more details in

1438 THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS
the minimum wage varies a lot across industries. The minimum
wage is highly binding in the restaurant sector with a missing
jobs estimate of 10.1%, whereas it does not appear to be binding
in the construction sector. The minimum wage is more binding in
the nontradeable sector (6.6%) than in the tradeable sector (1.6%)
or in the manufacturing sector (1.7%).
The effect of the minimum wage on employment also varies
by sector. We ﬁnd that the number of excess jobs at or above the
minimum wage is smaller than the missing jobs in the tradeable
sector, and so the employment effect is negative ( −11.1%, std.
err. 13.6%), but not statistically signiﬁcant. Similarly, the point
estimate in the manufacturing sector suggests that around 10.1%
(std. err. 14.5%) of the jobs directly affected by the minimum wage
are destroyed. The implied employment elasticity with respect to
own wage is quite large in magnitude in both sectors ( −1.910 in
the tradeable sector and −1.385 in manufacturing), although the
estimates are imprecise and statistically insigniﬁcant.
At the same time, we ﬁnd no indication for negative disem-
ployment effects in the nontradeable, restaurant, and retail sec-
tors where most minimum wage workers are employed in the
United States. The employment elasticity with respect to own
wage in the nontradeable sector is positive (0.387, std. err. 0.597),
which is in stark contrast to the tradeable sector, where we ﬁnd
a large negative elasticity. Harasztosi and Lindner (forthcoming)
ﬁnd similar sectoral patterns in Hungary and argue, using rev-
enue data, that the larger job losses for tradeables reﬂect a more
elastic consumer demand in that sector.
3. By Pretreatment Employment Status. We consider the ef-
fect of the minimum wage separately on workers who were em-
ployed prior to the minimum wage increase (incumbent workers)
and for new entrants into the labor market. We partition our sam-
ple of wage earners into incumbent workers and new entrants
by exploiting the fact that the CPS interviews each respondent
twice, exactly one year apart.28The partition limits our sample to
the 1992–2016 period, we ﬁrst replicate our benchmark analysis using all indus-
tries for this restricted sample in Table III , column (1). The estimated employment
and wage effects on this restricted sample are similar to the full 1979–2016 sample.
28. All CPS respondents are interviewed for four months in the ﬁrst interview
period, then rotated out of the survey for eight months, and then rotated back
into the survey for a ﬁnal four months of interviews. In the fourth month of eachDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

the 1980–2016 time period covering 137 eligible minimum wage-
raising events and also restricts our time window to one year
around the minimum wage increase rather than the ﬁve years in
our baseline sample.
Figure IV shows the event study estimates for new entrants
(Panel A) and incumbents (Panel B) for each k-dollar wage bin
relative to the new minimum wage. For both subgroups, new min-
imum wages clearly bind, with signiﬁcantly fewer jobs just below
and signiﬁcant more at the new minimum. This highlights that
studies that restricts their sample to incumbent workers (e.g.,
Currie and Fallick 1996 ;Abowd et al. 2000 ;Clemens and Wither
2019 ) can only provide a partial characterization of the full ef-
fects of the minimum wage increase, since new entrants are also
affected by the policy.
For both groups the excess jobs closely match the missing
jobs (for incumbents /Delta1a=1.3% and /Delta1b=− 1.2% and for new
entrants /Delta1a=0.6% and /Delta1b=− 0.5%), so the net employment
changes are approximately 0. The green and blue dashed lines
(color version available online) show the running sums of employ-
ment changes up to the corresponding wage bin for each group.
The lines show that in both cases there is little change in upper-
tail employment. We note that if employers are replacing lower-
skilled workers with higher-skilled ones, we should expect to see
some reduction in jobs for previously employed workers, perhaps
offset by high-skilled entrants; the lack of job loss for incumbents
provides additional evidence against such labor-labor substitu-
tion. The affected wage increase for incumbents (9.5%, std. err.
2.0%) is signiﬁcantly larger than it is for new entrants (1.9%, std.
err. 1.3%) and some of these differences can be explained by the
lack of spillover effects for the new entrants. In the next section
we return to this issue.
III.B. Wage Spillovers
So far we have focused on the employment effects of the
minimum wage. However, an equally important question is un-
derstanding the nature of the wage effects. In this section, we
quantify the direct effect of the minimum wage and the indirect
effect that comes from wage spillovers.

(Panel B) from our event study analysis (see equation (1) ) exploiting 138 state-level
minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016. The blue bars in Panel A (color

Panel B show the equivalent for incumbents. Incumbent workers were employed
a year prior to the minimum wage increase, whereas new entrants were not.
The error bars show the 95% conﬁdence interval calculated using standard errors
that are clustered at the state level. The dashed green and blue lines show the

EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGES ON LOW-WAGE JOBS 1441
We calculate the direct (or “no spillover”) wage increase by
moving each missing job under the new minimum wage exactly to
the new minimum wage:
(3) % /Delta1w no spillover =/summationtext−1
k=−4k(αk−α−1k)
wb−1.
The total wage increase of affected workers, % /Delta1w,i nequation (2)
incorporates this direct effect and the add-on effect from wage
spillovers. Therefore, the difference between the two measures,
%/Delta1w−%/Delta1wno spillover , provides an estimate of the size of the wage
spillovers.
Note that our spillover estimates use the frequency distri-
bution of wages, which contrasts with the earlier literature re-
lying on the density of wages (see, e.g., Card and Krueger 1995 ;
DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux 1996 ;Lee 1999 ;Autor, Manning,
and Smith 2016 ). As a result, changes in employment—which
could create an artiﬁcial spillover effect when using the wage
density—do not affect our estimates.
We report our estimates of wage spillovers in Table IV , where
the columns show estimates of the total wage effect % /Delta1w,t h e“ n o
spillover” wage effect % /Delta1wno spillover , and the spillover share of the
total wage increase calculated as%/Delta1w−%/Delta1w no spillover
%/Delta1w. The ﬁrst row
shows the estimated effects for the entire workforce. Column (1)
repeats the estimated total wage effect from Table I , column (1),
which is 6.8% (std. err. 1.0%). Column (2) shows that in the ab-
sence of spillovers, wages would increase by 4.1% (std. err. 0.9%).
Column (3) shows that 39.7% (std. err. 11.9%) of the total wage
effect is caused by the ripple effect of the minimum wage.
InTable IV we also report estimates for several subgroups.
The share of spillovers in the total wage increase is relatively sim-
ilar for several key demographic groups, such as those without a
high school degree (37.0%), teens (34.7%), those without a college
degree (40.2%), and women (35.9%). In most cases, the spillover
share is statistically signiﬁcantly different from 0 at the 5% level.
One exception is black or Hispanic individuals, for whom the es-
timated share of wage spillover is much smaller at 17.9% (std.
err. 26.5%), which is less than half of the 39.7% (std. err. 11.9%)
spillover share for all workers. Although the difference is not
statistically signiﬁcant, this ﬁnding nonetheless suggests that theDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

Notes. The table reports the effects of a minimum wage increase on wages based on the event study analysis
(see equation (1) ) exploiting 138 state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016. The table reports
the percentage change in affected wages with (column (1)) and without (column (2)) taking spillovers into
account for all workers, workers without a high school degree, teens, individuals with high school or less
schooling, women, black or Hispanic workers, in tradeable industries, in nontradeable industries, those who
were employed one year before the minimum wage increase (incumbents); and those who did not have a job
one year before (new entrants). The ﬁrst column is the estimated change in the affected wages calculated
according to equation (2) , and the second column assumes no spillovers (see equation (3) ). In the last column,
the spillover share of the wage effect is calculated by subtracting 1 from the ratio of the estimates in the
second to the ﬁrst column. Robust standard errors in parentheses are clustered by state; signiﬁcance levels

wage gains at the bottom may be more muted for some disadvan-
taged groups.29
We also ﬁnd a substantially smaller change in wages due
to spillovers in the tradeable sector, though the estimates here
are a bit imprecise. This highlights that wage effects are small
29. The smaller spillover for black/Hispanic workers is not due to sectoral
or incumbency composition, which are very similar to other workers (results not
reported).Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

in the tradeable sector. The combination of this evidence and the
disemployment effects suggest that there may be more unintended
consequences of minimum wages when the tradeable sector con-
stitutes a more sizable share of the affected workforce.
We also ﬁnd a stark difference in the spillover shares of wage
increases for incumbents versus new entrants. Incumbents re-
ceive a larger total wage increase (9.5%) than the overall work-
force (6.8%), but the spillover share for incumbents and all
workers is relatively similar (42.2% and 39.7%, respectively). In
contrast, the spillover share for entrants is −17.8%, suggesting
that essentially all of the wage increase received by new entrants
is by the creation of jobs at or very close to the new minimum.
Larger spillovers for incumbents relative to entrants can also be
seen in Figure IV . Two points should be noted.
First, the stark differences in the size and scope of spillovers
for the incumbent and for the new entrants are inconsistent with
a simple measurement error process common to both groups. This
suggests that spillover effects found are likely to reﬂect real re-
sponses and not measurement error in CPS-based wages, a possi-
bility that is raised by Autor, Manning, and Smith (2016) .30
Second, because we ﬁnd that essentially none of the wage
spillovers accrue to workers who were not employed prior to
the minimum wage increase, it is unlikely that our estimates of
spillovers primarily reﬂect an increase in the value of the outside
options or reservation wages of nonemployed workers (e.g., Flinn
2006 ). In contrast, the spillovers may reﬂect some “optimization
friction” that ﬁrms face when they set incumbent workers’ wages.
Kleven (2016) discusses a range of optimization frictions in the
context of bunching at kink points. Moreover, our results are also
consistent with Dube, Giuliano, and Leonard (2018) who argue
that ﬁrms are constrained by relative-pay norms inside the ﬁrm.
III.C. Event-Speciﬁc Estimates
So far, most of our evidence has come from averaging the
effects across all 138 events. In this section, we estimate treatment
30. In Online Appendix C we implement our approach using administrative
data from Washington. In that data we ﬁnd similar spillover effects which provides
additional evidence that the spillovers are not primarily caused by CPS-speciﬁc
misreporting by survey respondents. In addition, as shown in Online Appendix
Table F.3, our wage estimates are similar using a deconvolved distribution that
purges the type of measurement error proposed in Autor, Manning, and Smith
(2016) .Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

effects for each of the events separately and assess how these
impacts vary when we consider minimum wage increases that are
more binding.
For this purpose, we create 138 data sets, one for each event
h. The data sets include the state of event hand all clean control
states for an eight-year panel by event time. Clean control states
are those that do not have any nontrivial state minimum wage
increases in the eight-year panel around event h; other states are
dropped from data set h. We calculate the event-speciﬁc per capita
number of jobs in $1 wage bins relative to the minimum wage for
each state-by-year. Then, the regression equation is,
(4) Ysjth=4/summationdisplay
τ=−34/summationdisplay

where jindicates the jth dollar bin relative to the minimum wage.
Then, Ysjthis the per capita number of jobs in state stime t,a n d jth
bin relative to the minimum wage in data set h. The calculation
of the event-speciﬁc change in excess jobs above ( /Delta1ah), change in
missing jobs below ( /Delta1bh), and employment change ( /Delta1eh=/Delta1ah+
/Delta1bh) are similar to the ones described in Section II.B ./Omega1sjthcontrols
for other primary, federal, and small events whose ﬁve-year post-
treatment periods take place within the data set h. It takes the
value of 1 for all post-treatment periods of these events.31
Figure V , Panel (A) shows the nonparametric bin-scattered re-
lationship between the event-by-event estimates on missing jobs
31.Online Appendix Figure D.1 reports event-speciﬁc estimates for excess
and missing jobs, and employment effects, along with ( Ferman and Pinto, forth-
coming ) conﬁdence intervals that are appropriate for a single treated unit and
heteroskedasticity. Although there is considerable heterogeneity in the bite of the
policy, the distribution of employment estimates is consistent with the sharp null
of zero effect everywhere: only 5.3% of estimates are statistically signiﬁcant at
the 5% level. In addition, the stacked event-by-event estimates can be also used
to estimate the average effect of the minimum wage across events. In Online
Appendix Table D.1 we report estimates using that approach and show that esti-
mates are very similar to our panel regression-based event study. This shows that
issues about negative weighting using staggered treatments (e.g., Abraham and
Sun 2018 ) are unlikely to be driving our results. Finally, the event-by-event esti-
mates in Online Appendix Figure D.2 conﬁrm that the lack of leading effects and
upper-tail employment changes hold event by event, and not just on average: only
5.4% of the events experience statistically signiﬁcant upper-tail effects at the 5%
level, while 7.7% of the events experience statistically signiﬁcant leading effects.

Relationship between Excess Jobs, Missing Jobs, Employment Change, and the

The ﬁgure shows the binned scatter plots for missing jobs, excess jobs, and total
employment changes by the value of the minimum-to-median wage ratio (Kaitz
index) for the 130 event-speciﬁc estimates. The 130 events exclude 8 minimum-
wage-raising events in the District of Columbia, since individual treatment effects
are very noisily estimated for those events. (See Online Appendix Figure A.10 for
a raw scatterplot including the events in DC.) The minimum-to-median wage ratio
is the new minimum wage MW divided by the median wage at the time of the
minimum wage increase (Kaitz index). The bin-scatters and linear ﬁts control for
decade dummies, the state-speciﬁc unemployment rate at the time of the minimum
wage increase, the urban share of the state’s population, and an indicator for being
a Republican-leaning state. Estimates are weighted by the state populations. The
slope (and robust standard error in parentheses) is from the weighted linear ﬁt of
the outcome on the minimum-to-median wage ratio.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

and the new minimum wage.32To calculate the former we use the
ratio of the minimum wage to the median wage, also known as
the Kaitz index (e.g., Lee 1999 ;Dube 2014 ;Autor, Manning, and
Smith 2016 ;Manning 2016 ). When the minimum wage is high
relative to the median, it is expected to have a larger bite. Con-
sistent with that expectation, we ﬁnd that events hwith a higher
minimum-to-median wage ratio had substantially more missing
jobs—the coefﬁcient on Kaitz his sizable and statistically signiﬁ-
cant at −0.133 (std. err. 0.034). At the same time, when we con-
sider excess jobs, we ﬁnd that the coefﬁcient on Kaitz hhas a very
similar magnitude at 0.139 (std. err. 0.057). In other words, when
the minimum wage is high relative to the median, the events have
a bigger bite and a greater number of missing jobs below the new
minimum, but also have a nearly equally sized number of excess
jobs at or above the new minimum. As a consequence, the employ-
ment effect is virtually unchanged (slope =0.006, std. err. 0.048)
as we consider minimum wages that range between 37% and 59%
of the median wage, as shown in Figure V , Panel B. Overall, these
ﬁndings suggest that the level of the minimum wage increases in
the United States that we study have yet to reach a point where
the employment effects become sizable.
IV. E MPLOYMENT CHANGES ALONG THE WAGE DISTRIBUTION IN THE
CLASSIC TWO-WAYFIXED EFFECT REGRESSION ON LOGMINIMUM
WAGE
In the previous section, we estimated the impact of minimum
wages on the wage distribution using our event study speciﬁca-
tion. We found that the effect of the minimum wage was concen-
trated at the bottom of the wage distribution, and reassuringly
we found no indication of considerable employment changes in
the upper tail of the wage distribution (see Figure II ). The lack of
responses $4 above the minimum wage or higher also implies that
the effect of the minimum wage on aggregate employment is close
to the estimated employment effect at the bottom of the wage dis-
tribution. Such stability of upper-tail employment is consistent
with the observation that the share of workers affected by the

mum wage increase, political orientation of the state, urban share of the state, and
the decade of the minimum wage increase. However, the results are very similar
if we leave out controls; see Online Appendix Figure A.9.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGES ON LOW-WAGE JOBS 1447
minimum wage changes we study is too small to affect upper-tail
employment to a noticeable degree.
In this section, we estimate the effect of the minimum wage
on employment throughout the wage distribution using alterna-
tive identiﬁcation strategies to illustrate the advantage of the
distributional approach in diagnosing research designs. Recent
empirical literature using the classic two-way ﬁxed effect speciﬁ-
cation with log minimum wage (TWFE-logMW), has found large
aggregate disemployment effects in the U.S. context (see Meer and
West 2016 ).
We decompose the classic two-way ﬁxed effects estimate of
log minimum wage on the state-level employment-to-population
rate. In Figure VI we divide the total wage-earning employment in
the 1979–2016 Current Population Survey into inﬂation-adjusted
$1-wage bins by state and by year. Then, for each wage bin, we
regress that wage bin’s employment per capita on the contempo-
raneous, four annual lags, and two annual leads of log minimum
wage, along with state and time ﬁxed effects.33This distributed-
lags speciﬁcation is similar to those used in numerous papers (e.g.,
Meer and West 2016 ;Allegretto et al. 2017 ).34The histogram bars
show the average post-treatment effect divided by the sample av-
erage employment-to-population rate,35while the dashed purple
line (color version available online) plots the running sum of the
employment effects of the minimum wage up to the particular
wage bin. The ﬁnal purple bar represents the estimated effect on
the aggregate employment to population rate.
Figure VI shows that on average, minimum wage shocks
are associated with large employment changes in the real dol-
lar bins in the $6 to $9/hour range. There is a sharp decrease in
33. In the TWFE-logMW model, the point estimates for the leads and lags
show the impact relative to the employment in the third year or earlier. Once we
normalize the TWFE-logMW estimates to the ﬁrst lead, we can report three leads
and four lags, similarly to our benchmark estimates.
34.Meer and West (2016) present unweighted results on the total employment
effect of the minimum wage. Here we present estimates weighted by the population
size because it is more standard in the literature and also closer to our event study
estimates. However, as we show in Online Appendix Figure A.11, the unweighted
estimates are similar.
35. We construct the cumulative response over event dates 0, 1, ..., 4 relative
to event date −1 by successively summing the coefﬁcients for contemporaneous
and lagged minimum wages. We then average the cumulative responses over dates
0, 1, ..., 4. This average post-treatment effect is analogous to what we did in our
event-based analysis in the previous sections.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

Impact on Employment throughout the Wage Distribution in the Two-Way Fixed
Effects Model on Log Minimum Wages
The ﬁgure shows the effect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution in
ﬁxed effects (TWFE-logMW) speciﬁcation. We estimate two-way (state and year)
ﬁxed effects regressions on the contemporaneous log minimum wage, as well as on
four annual lags and two annual leads. For each wage bin we run a separate regres-
sion, where the outcome is the number of jobs per capita in that state-wage bin.
The cumulative response for each event date 0, 1, ..., 4 is formed by successively
adding the coefﬁcients for the contemporaneous and lagged log minimum wages.
The green histogram bars (color version available online) show the mean of these
cumulative responses for event dates 0, 1, ..., 4, divided by the sample average
employment-to-population rate—and represent the average elasticity of employ-
ment in each wage bin with respect to the minimum wage in the post-treatment
period. The 95% conﬁdence intervals around the point estimates are calculated
using clustered standard errors at the state level. The dashed purple line plots
the running sum of the employment effects of the minimum wage up until the
particular wage bin. The rightmost solid purple bar is the elasticity of the over-
all state employment-to-population with respect to the minimum wage, obtained
from regressions where the outcome variable is the state-level employment-to-
population rate. In the bottom left corner we also report the point estimate on this
elasticity with standard errors that are clustered at the state level. Regressions
are weighted by state population. The ﬁgure highlights that large aggregate dis-
employment effects are often driven by shifts in employment at the upper tail of
the wage distribution.

EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGES ON LOW-WAGE JOBS 1449
the same time, the ﬁgure shows consistent, negative employment
effects of the minimum wage for levels far above the minimum
wage: indeed, the aggregate negative employment elasticity (e.g.,
−0.137) accrues almost entirely in wage bins exceeding $15/hour.
It strikes us as implausible that a minimum wage increase
in the $8 to $9/hour range causally leads to losses of jobs mostly
at or above the median wage, even though the minimum wage is
binding far lower in the wage distribution. More plausibly, this
suggests that the speciﬁcation is confounded by negative employ-
ment shocks to the upper part of the wage distribution (possibly
much earlier than the actual treatment dates), and these shocks
are not fully absorbed by the simple two-way ﬁxed effect spec-
iﬁcations estimated using a long panel. For instance, as shown
inOnline Appendix Table G.2, the negative employment changes
shown in Figure VI arise only for the Card and Krueger low-
probability group, which should not be affected by the minimum
wage. At the same time, the high- and medium-probability groups
exhibit no negative disemployment effect.
How is it possible that our benchmark speciﬁcation that fo-
cuses on employment changes around the event window leads to
such different results compared to the TWFE-logMW speciﬁca-
tion? The differences in the estimates suggest that the negative
employment changes in the upper part of the wage distribution
in TWFE-logMW must come from outside of the event window.
Indeed, we ﬁnd that the employment losses are driven by the
1980s expansion and the 1990–1991 recession, even though most
of the minimum wage changes in our sample occurred after 2000.
When we restrict the regression to the 1993–2016 period—the pe-
riod where 86% (118
138) of all our events occurred—we indeed ﬁnd
very similar estimates across the two speciﬁcations: the TWFE-
logMW speciﬁcation in this sample suggests small employment ef-
fects and little upper-tail employment changes ( Online Appendix
Figure G.5). Moreover, even if we limit our sample to the 39
states with no state minimum wage increases until the late
1990s, the negative disemployment effects are driven entirely
by the inclusion of a period (1980s) long before any cross-state
variation in treatment occurred in these states (see Online Ap-
pendix Table G.5).
We also show in Online Appendix Figure G.4 that the over-
all employment-to-population rate evolved very similarly between
the early 1990s and 2016 in high minimum wage states (those
that instituted a minimum exceeding the federal standard afterDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

the early 1990s) and low minimum wage states (where the fed-
eral standard was always binding). This is noteworthy because
the period between the early 1990s and 2016 is when much of
the cross-sectional variation in minimum wages emerged. Impor-
tantly, however, the employment-to-population rate had diverged
between these two groups of states during the 1980s, at least a
decade before most high minimum wage states started to raise
their minimum wage. This creates a spurious correlation between
employment changes in the 1980s and minimum wage changes
in the early 2000s that confounds the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation
in the full sample, which is sensitive to shocks occurring long be-
fore the event window. However, this does not affect our event
study estimates, since these only consider employment changes
within the event window. This also explains why we do not ﬁnd any
pre-existing trends in our event-based analysis, while the TWFE-
logMW in the full sample exhibits sizable and statistically signif-
icant leads. At the same time, TWFE-logMW estimates restricted
to the post-1992 sample produce neither sizable leads nor sizable
employment effects (see further details in Online Appendix G ).36
The foregoing example illustrates that showing the effect of
the minimum wage throughout the wage distribution can provide
additional falsiﬁcation tests and therefore can be a useful tool for
model selection. This type of model selection tool can be particu-
larly helpful in the context of minimum wages, where the liter-
ature has often grappled with ﬁguring out the “right” empirical
model.37
36. Why are the expansion in the 1980s and the downturn in the 1990–1991
recession related to future minimum wage changes? Because the expansion and
downturn were more pronounced for states that would be more Democratic-leaning
in the 2000s. One possibility is that the 1990–1991 recession was so severe in some
states that it changed the political landscape and opened the door for candidates
supporting minimum wages. However, another explanation is that the 1990–1991
recession just happened to be more pronounced for Democratic-leaning states—
states that would also be more inclined to raise the minimum wage starting in
the early 2000s following a long period of federal inaction. In Online Appendix G
we show that this latter explanation ﬁts the data better. In particular, we show
that the predictive power of the severity of recession on future minimum wage
increases disappears once we control for the partisan voting index (PVI) in the
2000s and instrument that variable with the PVI in 1988 (i.e., prior to the 1990–
1991 recession).
37.Online Appendix G also uses these ﬁndings to provide a reconciliation
of other longstanding discrepancies in the minimum wage literature. We show in

EFFECT OF MINIMUM WAGES ON LOW-WAGE JOBS 1451
V. D ISCUSSION
In this article we infer the employment effects of the mini-
mum wage from the change in the frequency distribution of wages.
The key advantage of this approach is that it allows us to assess
the overall impact of the minimum wage on low-wage workers,
who are the primary target of minimum wage policies. We use
an event study analysis exploiting 138 prominent minimum wage
increases and provide a robust and comprehensive assessment of
how minimum wages affect the frequency distribution of wages.
Second, we calculate the number of missing jobs just below the
minimum wage, the number of excess jobs at or slightly above the
minimum wage, and the job changes in the upper tail of the wage
distribution. Our main estimates show that the number of excess
jobs at and slightly above the minimum wage closely matches
the number of missing jobs just below the minimum wage, and
we ﬁnd no evidence for employment changes at or more than
$4 above the minimum wage. A similar pattern obtains for low-
skilled workers, suggesting labor-labor substitution is unlikely to
be a factor in our setting. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the level of the
minimum wages that we study—which range between 37% and
59% of the median wage—have yet to reach a point where the job
losses become sizable. However, the employment consequences of
a minimum wage that surpass the ones studied here remain an
open question. Furthermore, if minimum wage increases affect
tradeable sectors more, our ﬁndings suggest employment effects
may be more pronounced.
A key advantage of tracking job changes throughout the wage
distribution is that we can transparently show the source of any
disemployment effects. As a result, we can detect when an empir-
ical speciﬁcation suggests an unrealistic impact on the shape of
the wage distribution. More important, the relationship between
minimum wages and the wage distribution can also be used to
infer the structure of low-wage labor markets. While providing a
uniﬁed theoretical framework is beyond the scope of this article,
ing 1990–1991 is also responsible for the sensitivity of teen employment estimates
to speciﬁcation that has plagued the literature, such as controls for trends (e.g.,
Neumark, Salas, and Wascher 2014 ;Allegretto et al. 2017 ). In the post-1992 period,
there is little divergence in teen elasticity across standard speciﬁcations (includ-
ing the TWFE-logMW): they all suggest any losses to teen employment are small,
with elasticities no more negative than −0.03. Use of trend controls also matters
little in the post-1992 sample which is where most minimum wage variation is.Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/qje/article/134/3/1405/5484905 by guest on 29 February 2024

In many countries,  women are over-represented  among low-wage  employees,  which is why a wage ﬂoor could 
beneﬁt them particularly.  Following  this notion, we analyse the impact of the German  minimum  wage intro- 
duction in 2015 on the gender wage gap. Germany  poses an interesting  case study in this context,  since it has 
a rather high gender wage gap and set the minimum  wage at a relatively  high level, aﬀecting  more than four 
million employees.  Based on individual  data from the Structure  of Earnings  Survey, containing  information  for 
over one million employees  working  in 60,000 ﬁrms, we use a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  framework  that exploits 
regional  diﬀerences  in the bite of the minimum  wage. We ﬁnd a signiﬁcant  negative  eﬀect of the minimum  wage 
on the regional  gender wage gap. Between  2014 and 2018, the gap at the 10th percentile  of the wage distribu-  
tion was reduced  by 4.6 percentage  points (or 32%) in regions that were strongly  aﬀected  by the minimum  wage 
compared  to less aﬀected  regions. For the gap at the 25th percentile,  the eﬀect still amounted  to − 18%, while for 
the mean it was smaller ( − 11%) and not particularly  robust. We thus ﬁnd that the minimum  wage can indeed 
reduce gender wage disparities.  While the eﬀect is highest for the low-paid,  it also reaches up into higher parts 
of the wage distribution.  
1. Introduction  
The diﬀerences  between  men’s and women’s  earnings  have been 
studied  extensively  over recent years. One of its dimensions  is the fact 
that women  are often overrepresented  among the low-paid  employees  
( Card et al., 2016; Kahn, 2015 ). This leads to the existence  of a wage gap 
at the bottom  of the distribution,  also called ‘sticky ﬂoors’, and one pos- 
sible way to alleviate  this issue is the introduction  of a minimum  wage. 
If female employees  are more prevalent  among the wage ﬂoor beneﬁ- 
ciaries than their male counterparts,  they should also be disproportion-  
ately aﬀected  by a minimum  wage, which would reduce wage dispari-  
ties and thus the gender wage gap. In their seminal  paper, DiNardo  et al. 
(1996) ﬁnd that labour market institutions  such as a minimum  wage can 
indeed reduce inequality,  especially  so for women.  This line of research  has been continued  by an ample number  of studies establishing  a nega- 
tive relationship  between  the minimum  wage and the gender wage gap 
for a variety of countries.  1 
In this context,  Germany  poses an interesting  case study. On the one 
hand, it is a country  with a relatively  high gender wage gap, especially  
at the bottom  of the wage distribution.  In 2014, the diﬀerence  between  
the earnings  of full-time  employed  men and full-time  employed  women  
amounted  to 17.2 percent  in Germany,  placing  it in the upper third of 
countries  with the highest  gaps, above the OECD average  (see Fig. 1 a). 2 
At the ﬁrst decile of the wage distribution,  Germany  even shows a wage 
diﬀerence  of 18.2% in 2014, placing  it among the eight countries  with 
the highest  gaps among low-income  earners,  and well above the United 
States and the United Kingdom  (see Fig. 1 b). It is thus evident  that Ger- 
many suﬀers from high gender wage discrepancies  in an OECD com-

2 In this paper, we look at the unadjusted  wage gap , also called the raw gap. A substantial  part of the raw gap can be explained  by observable  factors, such as 
diﬀerences  in schooling,  working  hours, etc. For Germany,  these factors can explain around three quarters  of the gap ( Destatis,  2020 ). The remaining  unexplained  
part is called adjusted gap .

many introduced  a nationwide  minimum  wage in 2015, which was set 
at a comparably  high level and had only few exemptions.  4 With €8.50 
gross per hour, it ranked among the highest  wage ﬂoors in Europe in

about ten percent  of the eligible  workers  ( Destatis,  2016 ). Among  them, 
women  were vastly overrepresented,  since they accounted  for two-thirds  
of aﬀected  employees  ( Burauel  et al., 2017; Mindestlohnkommission,  
2016b ). This has been attributed  to insuﬃcient  regulations  of the low- 
pay sector and gender segregation,  which lead to an unequal  coverage  
of collective  bargaining  agreements  for men and women  ( Grimshaw  and 
Rubery,  2013; Herzog-Stein  et al., 2018 ). Accordingly,  the introduction  
of the wage ﬂoor could have an inﬂuence  on gender inequality.  In a sim- 
3 One reason for Germany’s  particularly  high gender wage gap is its comparably  high 
female employment  rate (72.7% in 2018), with many women working part-time  (46.3% 
in 2018, Source: Eurostat).  As Boll and Lagemann  (2018) point out, ﬂexibility  in working 
arrangements  and rather egalitarian  gender roles allow more low-skilled  and part-time  
working women to enter the labour market, which in turn leads to larger gender wage 
discrepancies.  
4 The law only stipulated  a few exemptions,  mainly minors, trainees, speciﬁc in- 
terns, volunteers  and long-term  unemployed.  Additionally,  employees  in sectors with pre- 
existing wage ﬂoors below €8.50 were exempted  until the end of 2016 (for details, see 
also Caliendo et al., 2019 ). For the Minimum  Wage Act, see https://www.gesetze-im-  
internet.de/englisch_milog/index.html  , last accessed on November  11, 2021. ulation study, Boll et al. (2015) predict that in the absence  of job losses, 
the minimum  wage could reduce the average  gender wage gap in Ger- 
many by 2.5 percentage  points; and with job losses, the eﬀect could 
even be larger. This points to a potential  caveat, namely  that low-paid  
women  quitting  or losing their jobs could cause a decrease  in the gap. 
However,  since all ex-post  evaluation  studies ﬁnd only small employ-  
ment eﬀects and no strong evidence  of gender-speciﬁc  job-losses  (see, 
e.g., Bonin et al., 2018; Caliendo  et al., 2019; Pestel et al., 2020 ), this 
does not seem to be an issue in Germany.  
In our analysis,  we mainly employ  data from 2014 and 2018, which 
we obtain from the Structure  of Earnings  Survey (SES), a large obliga- 
tory survey that comprises  detailed  wage information  for over one mil- 
lion employees  working  in 60,000 ﬁrms. First, we descriptively  look at 
the wages of male and female employees  who are eligible  for the min- 
imum wage and compare  the wage gap in 2014 with the one in 2018. 
Second,  following  Card (1992) , we make use of regional  variation  in the 
“minimum  wage bite ”, i.e. the degree to which a region is aﬀected  by 
the minimum  wage, and analyse  the causal eﬀects of the minimum  wage 
introduction  on regional  gender wage gaps. 5 We are able to identify  a 
signiﬁcant  eﬀect on the wage gap at the regional  level, especially  for 
low-paid  employees.  Between  2014 and 2018, the gap at the 10th per- 
centile was reduced  by 4.6 percentage  points (or 32%) in regions  that 
5 Since our post-reform  data is from 2018, in our analysis we estimate the eﬀect of 
both the initial introduction  of the minimum  wage as well the ﬁrst increase from 2017. 
However,  previous research shows that the reform had mainly signiﬁcant  wage eﬀects 
in 2015, whereas there were no relevant eﬀects after the ﬁrst increase in 2017 ( Burauel 
et al., 2020b; Fedorets et al., 2019 ).

were strongly  aﬀected  by the minimum  wage compared  to less aﬀected  
regions.  For the gap at the 25th percentile,  the eﬀect still amounted  to 
− 18%, while for the mean it was smaller  ( − 11%) and not particularly  
robust. Using a continuous  bite measure,  we can show that an increase  
in a region’s  bite by ten percentage  points, reduces  the wage at the 10th 
percentile  by 3.3 percentage  points. This thus shows that the minimum  
wage reform led to a signiﬁcant  decrease  in the wage gap especially  at 
the bottom  of the wage distribution.  
The remainder  of this paper proceeds  as follows.  Section  2 reviews  
the previous  literature  on gender-speciﬁc  minimum  wage eﬀects on 
wages and presents  the data that we use. Additionally,  it oﬀers a ﬁrst 
descriptive  overview  of the gender-speciﬁc  wages before and after the 
reform,  as well as the regional  diﬀerences  in the wage gap and the bite 
measure.  Section  3.2 then presents  the identiﬁcation  strategy  and dis- 
plays the results of the main estimation  and the robustness  analyses.  In 
Section  4 , we summarise  our results.  
2. Previous  evidence,  data and descriptives  
2.1. Previous  evidence  
The previous  evidence  on gender-speciﬁc  wage eﬀects of the Ger- 
man minimum  wage is scarce. In a descriptive  analysis  with the Socio- 
Economic  Panel (SOEP),  Herzog-Stein  et al. (2018) ﬁnd that the wage 
gap at the tenth percentile  had reduced  by seven percentage  points (from 
22% to 15%) two years after the reform,  which the authors  attribute  to 
the minimum  wage. Interestingly,  the gender gap stagnated  for the low- 
est paid ﬁve percent  (at 18%), which they relate to circumvention  strate- 
gies. Ohlert (2018) looks at wages below €10 in 2014 and 2015 and 
ﬁnds that women’s  wages increased  more strongly  (14.6%)  than men’s 
wages (11.3%)  in East Germany,  while in the former West German  states 
there was no gender-speciﬁc  diﬀerence.  6 Additionally,  some causal stud- 
ies on wage eﬀects have included  some gender-speciﬁc  heterogeneity  
analyses.  However,  they do not estimate  the eﬀect on the wage gap it- 
self and suﬀer from small samples  sizes. Burauel  et al. (2018) ﬁnd that 
between  2014 and 2016 the minimum  wage eﬀect on hourly wages was 
signiﬁcant  for women  and amounted  to about 5.9%. While the male 
eﬀect was larger, it did not satisfy the common  trend assumption,  chal- 
lenging  the results for this subgroup.  Bachmann  et al. (2020) ﬁnd that 
female employees  earning  less than €8.50 in 2014 experienced  a statis- 
tically signiﬁcant  wage growth  of 5.7% directly  after the reform,  while 
the eﬀect for men was postponed:  they beneﬁted  from a wage growth  of 
about 10.2% from 2015 to 2016 and 14.8% in the following  year. There 
was no such eﬀect on women’s  wages at this time. Overall,  previous  
studies ﬁnd indications  that wages among the low-paid  employees  rose 
due to the minimum  wage introduction.  7 Moreover,  there is evidence  
that women’s  wages rose more strongly  shortly after the reform and 
men’s eﬀects were possibly  postponed.  However,  none of these studies 
have explicitly  examined  the eﬀects of the minimum  wage on the gender 
wage gap. 
2.2. Data sources and preparation  
There are only a few datasets  that are suitable  for evaluating  the 
minimum  wage eﬀects in Germany.  All of them have diﬀerent  advan- 
tages but also caveats  and neither  is completely  ideal. The diﬀerences  
as well as the associated  issues have been widely discussed  before (see, 
e.g., Caliendo  et al., 2019; Mindestlohnkommission,  2020b ). In this pa- 
per, we rely on the SES , 8 provided  by the Federal  Statistical  Oﬃce of 
6 However,  the results are based on the voluntary  Earnings Survey (ES) and are poten- 
tially inﬂuenced  by selectivity  issues (see Dütsch et al., 2019; Ohlert, 2018 ). 
7 See also Ahlfeldt et al. (2018) , who ﬁnd that wages in lowwage counties increased  
more rapidly than in highwage  counties,  particularly  so for low-paid employees.  
8 Source: FDZ der Statistischen  Ämter des Bundes und der Länder, Verdienststruktur-  
erhebung,  2010; 2014; 2018 . Germany  (Destatis).  It is a rich earnings  survey in which employers  are 
obligated  to participate.  Next to ﬁrm level data, the SES entails detailed  
individual  information  taken directly  from payroll accounting  or person-  
nel statistics.  It has ﬁrst been collected  in 1951 and takes place every 
four years since 2006. In this paper, we mainly make use of the most 
direct pre- and post-reform  waves that are available,  namely  2014 and 
2018. Additionally,  we look at the data from 2010 in Section  3.3 in order 
to check the pre-treatment  trends. 
The SES 2014 and 2018 are well suited for our analysis  since they are 
large datasets,  that each contain  more than 1 million  employees  working  
in over 60,000 ﬁrms. The businesses  were obliged  to provide  informa-  
tion on wages, working  hours, and other working  conditions,  allowing  
us to construct  precise hourly wages. However,  two caveats  should also 
be noted. First of all, it does not take place yearly, forcing us to look 
at a rather long time-frame.  Second,  it is not a panel study but largely 
comprises  repeated  cross sections.  The recent waves include  employ-  
ees from nearly all economic  sectors that have at least one employee.  
Nonetheless,  we exclude  public sector employees,  since for them there 
is no detailed  regional  information  available  beyond  the federal state. 
However,  since this sector does not typically  suﬀer from low wages, it is 
not strongly  aﬀected  by the minimum  wage. The SES is representative  
at the level of the sixteen federal states. In order to exploit the regional  
variation  of the minimum  wage bite, we follow previous  studies (see for 
example  Bachmann  et al., 2020 ) and rely on the smaller  257 labour mar- 
ket regions  ( “Arbeitsmarktregionen  ”). Moreover,  in a sensitivity  analysis  
we also look at planning  regions  ( “Raumordnungsregionen  ”) and districts  
( “Kreise und kreisfreie  Städte ”), the former being a less and the latter a 
more disaggregated  regional  classiﬁcation  (see Section  3.4 ). 
Since the SES does not collect data on hourly wages, we compute  
them using monthly  income  and working  hours. We employ  the gross 
monthly  earnings  and subtract  earnings  received  for premiums  and over- 
time worked.  We divide this by the number  of paid working  hours (ex- 
cluding  overtime).  9 In our analysis,  we only look at employees  who are 
eligible  for the minimum  wage. We thus exclude  trainees,  interns as well 
as minors without  a vocational  training.  10 We generate  the gender wage 
gap at the regional  level as the diﬀerence  between  men’s and women’s  
wages divided  by men’s wages. We do this for regional  mean wages 
but also with the wages at the 10th and 25th percentiles  of the gender-  
speciﬁc  wage distributions.  This allows us to look at wage diﬀerences  
not only at the mean but also speciﬁcally  among low-paid  employees.  
2.3. Descriptive  statistics  
Wage gap and fraction  of aﬀected  employees  As a ﬁrst step in our em- 
pirical analysis,  we examine  diﬀerent  aspects  of the gender wage gap 
descriptively.  11 As shown in Table 1 , we rely on information  for 755,431  
individuals  in 2014 and 742,716  individuals  in 2018. 12 The mean wage 
of employees  in our sample amounted  to €16.8 in 2014. While men 
eligible  for the minimum  wage earned about €19.0 on average,  their 
female counterparts  earned only €14.4. This translates  into a gender 
9 If the number of paid working hours is not known, we divide by regular weekly work- 
ing hours times 4.33, which is the average number of weeks in a month. 
10 Since we cannot identify employees  working in sectors with pre-existing  wage ﬂoors 
below €8.50, we follow previous studies and include them in our analysis (see e.g., Ohlert, 
2018 ). This should not aﬀect our results as these were only few sectors and regulations  ran 
out at the end of 2016 ( Mindestlohnkommission,  2016b ). Nevertheless,  we will address 
this issue in our robustness  analysis. 
11 The SES provides individual  weights that we use for the general descriptives  and the 
calculation  of regional wages and wage distributions.  While the weights yield representa-  
tive results on the level of federal states, they do not necessarily  do so for a smaller regional 
level (see FDZ, 2019 , for details). Therefore  we exclude the weights as a sensitivity  check 
in Section 3.4 . 
12 The unweighted  share of women in the sample amounts to 46% in 2014 and 44.9% 
in 2018. When taking into account personal weights of the employees  –which we also do 
in our regressions  later on –the share of females amounts to 47.8% in 2014 and 47.1% in 
2018.

wage gap of 24.5%. 13 Four years later, wages had increased  overall,  but 
women’s  wages more strongly.  Consistently,  the wage gap at the mean 
decreased  to 21.9% in 2018. Appendix  Table A.3 shows, that the largest 
reduction  in the gender wage gap was realized  among part-time  employ-  
ees, where the gap decreased  by 4.4 percentage  points and among the 
25- to 54-year-old  workers  ( − 3.3 percentage  points).  However,  the gap 
decreased  for all examined  subgroups,  except for marginally  employed  
workers,  where men experienced  larger wage increases  than women,  
which is why the gap actually  increased  for them. 
It also becomes  apparent  that women  were overrepresented  in the 
low-wage  sector. In 2014, 9.3% of men but 16.3% of women  were earn- 
ing less than €8.50 per hour. Looking  at the ﬁrst minimum  wage in- 
crease to €8.84, nearly every ﬁfth woman  (19.8%)  in our sample was 
aﬀected  in 2014, compared  with only 11.5% of men. Four years later, 
i.e. after the introduction  and ﬁrst increase  of the minimum  wage, less 
than one percent  of either gender earned less than €8.50 and 2.8% of 
employees  earned less than €8.84. However,  among women  the percent-  
age was slightly  larger than among men, suggesting  that women  were 
disproportionately  aﬀected  by non-compliance  with the wage ﬂoor. 14 
13 It should be noted that the gender wage gap in our sample is larger than that for the 
overall population  found in other studies. This is caused by diﬀerent factors. First, we do 
not include public sector personnel,  whose inclusion  would lead to the gap being smaller. 
Second, we only look at workers who are not exempt from the minimum  wage. Finally, we 
focus on the raw/unadjusted  gender wage gap, while many studies examine the (lower) 
adjusted gap. 
14 All evaluations  of (non-)compliance  ﬁnd that a substantial  number of eligible workers 
were paid less than the minimum  wage even after the reform. This is, for example,  un- Wage gap over the distribution  Our sample displays  a higher wage gap 
at the top of the wage distribution:  in 2014, it amounted  to 31% at 
the 90th percentile,  but to only about 10% at the ﬁrst decile. However,  
the largest decrease  in the gap is found at the bottom:  at the 10th per- 
centile,  the gap decreased  by 3.84 percentage  points. A more detailed  
representation  of this is displayed  in Fig. 2 . Here, we depict the wage 
gap at twenty quantiles.  Between  2014 and 2018, the gap decreased  
along the whole distribution,  but especially  up to the 15th percentile.  
Remembering  that 16.3% (19.8%)  of women  earned less than €8.50 
( €8.84) in 2014, this indicates  a connection  to the minimum  wage in- 
troduction.  The strongest  reduction  took place at the ﬁfth percentile,  
where the gender wage gap in hourly wages decreased  from 8.5% to 
1.3% among eligible  employees  in our sample.  There was also a strong 
reduction  in the gap at the 10th and 15th percentile.  However,  at the 
20th and 25th percentiles  –i.e. above the share of aﬀected  women  –it 
remained  nearly constant.  
Regional  variation  and development  Our ﬁndings  are also underlined  
by Fig. 3 , which displays  the regional  variation  in the gender wage gap 
derlined by the ﬁndings of ( Burauel et al., 2020a ), who –based on the employee-reported  
Socio-Economic  Panel (SOEP) –ﬁnd that the minimum  wage reduced contractual  working 
hours, but had a smaller and insigniﬁcant  eﬀect on actual working hours. This is to say, 
that while hours were reduced on paper, employees  in fact work more or less the same 
amount of time. Estimations  of the magnitude  of that issue diﬀer depending  on the data 
source and we cannot account for this in our estimation.  However,  this issue seems to have 
been more important  shortly after the minimum  wage introduction:  For 2015, estimations  
of the share of eligible employees  earning less than the wage ﬂoor range from 2.8% to 
11% ( Burauel et al., 2017; Mindestlohnkommission,  2018b ). For 2018, non-compliance  
was put in the range of 1.3% to 6.8% ( Mindestlohnkommission,  2020b ).

at the ﬁrst decile, i.e. one of the dependent  variables  in our later anal- 
ysis. Fig. 3 a and b map the gap in 2014 and 2018, where red colouring  
indicates  a positive  wage gap and blue colouring  a negative  gap. The 
higher the absolute  value, the higher the colour intensity.  Fig. 3 c dis- 
plays the diﬀerence  in the gap between  the two years. 15 It highlights  the 
fact that the gap among the low-paid  decreased  from 2014 to 2018 in 
most regions.  Additionally,  we see that in the East of Germany,  the pic- 
ture is rather homogeneous:  the gap at the 10th percentile  was reduced  
in all East German  regions,  in many of them between  ﬁve and ﬁfteen 
percentage  points. However,  in the West, the development  is more di- 
verse. There are some regions  that experienced  a strong decrease  in the 
gap, but also regions  in which the gap substantially  increased.  16 
The minimum  wage bite Another  variable  central for our analysis  is 
the minimum  wage bite, measuring  the degree to which a region was 
aﬀected  by the minimum  wage in 2014. The literature  features  a variety 
of bite measures  such as the fraction  of aﬀected  employees  or the Kaitz 
index (see also Caliendo  et al., 2018 ). However,  the Kaitz index indi- 
cates the ratio between  the minimum  wage and the regional  mean wage 
and it is thus also aﬀected  by other determinants  of the mean wage, 
which is why we focus on the fraction  of aﬀected  employees.  More pre- 
cisely, we employ  the regional  share of eligible  women  earning  less than 
the wage ﬂoor in relation  to all eligible  women  (henceforth  called ‘frac- 
tion’), since we aim to identify  regions  in which women  were especially  
aﬀected  by the minimum  wage. Fig. 4 a displays  the fraction  for the 257 
labour market regions  in 2014. It can be seen that –in contrast  to the 
wage gap –t h e bite is generally  higher in the East of Germany.  How- 
ever, there are also regions  in the West where women  are aﬀected  above 
average.  For the empirical  analysis  later on, we will use a binary “high- 
bite ”i n d i c a t o r  and split the sample into high- and low-bite  regions  at 
the median  bite level of 17.15%.  Fig. 4 b shows the regional  distribution  
of this new indicator.  While all regions  in East Germany  are high-bite  
regions  (equal or above the median)  and receive  a value of 1 for this 
15 Note that in the regional descriptives,  information  for Saxony is averaged  over all 
Saxon labour market regions due to data approval issues. However,  in our later analysis, 
we use detailed data on the ten Saxon regions. 
16 It has to be noted, tough, that the wage gaps in upper regions of the distribution  are 
higher in West Germany  than in East Germany.  Previous studies show that these diﬀer- 
ences between the two parts of the country are rather caused by the fact that men earn 
more in the West than that women earn less. Men tend to especially  beneﬁt in regions were 
large businesses  oﬀer high-paid  jobs in production,  manufacturing  and research ( Fuchs 
et al., 2019 ). Additionally,  socio-cultural  diﬀerences,  such as diverging  traditional  gen- 
der roles that lead to higher shares of female part-time  employment  and lower childcare  
availability  in the West, are explanatory  factors as well ( Hobler et al., 2020 ). indicator,  it also becomes  clear that high-bite  regions  are found across 
the whole country.  
3. Methodological  approach  and results  
3.1. Empirical  approach  
In this paper, we aim to identify  the impact of the German  mini- 
mum wage on the gender wage gap. In our identiﬁcation  strategy,  we 
follow Card (1992) , who proposes  an approach  relying on regional  vari- 
ation (also employed  by other authors,  e.g. Caliendo  et al., 2018; Dolton 
et al., 2015; 2010; 2012; Stewart,  2002 ). In contrast  to other methods,  
it therefore  does not depend  on diﬀerences  in legislation,  which do not 
occur in the German  case (see also Caliendo  et al., 2018 ). The approach  
incorporates  the intuition  that regional  wages have to adapt to varying  
degrees  in accordance  with the introduction  of a minimum  wage. In re- 
gions where wages were lower prior to the introduction,  the minimum  
wage is assumed  to bite harder into the wage distribution  and its eﬀect 
on potential  outcomes  is thus expected  to be stronger.  The correspond-  
ing ﬁxed eﬀects estimation  equation  of the gender wage gap is deﬁned  
as follows:  
𝐺𝑎𝑝 𝑗,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑟 + 𝛽𝑇 2018 
𝑡 + 𝛿𝑇 2018 
𝑡 𝐵 𝑖𝑡𝑒 2014 
𝑗 + 𝛾𝑋 𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜐𝑗,𝑡 , with 𝑡 = { 2014 , 2018 } 
(1) 
where 𝐺𝑎𝑝 𝑗,𝑡 denotes  the gender wage gap in percent  in region 𝑗at time 
𝑡 . 𝛼𝑟 is a region-ﬁxed  eﬀect and 𝑇 2018 
𝑡 is a dummy  taking the value of 1 
in the year 2018. 𝑋 𝑗,𝑡 is a set of regional  controls  and 𝜐𝑗,𝑡 is the error 
term. 𝐵𝑖𝑡𝑒 2014 
𝑗 denotes  the regional  bite. While we use the fraction  of 
aﬀected  women  in our main analysis,  we also make use of the fraction  
of aﬀected  employees  over both genders  in our sensitivity  analysis.  In 
order to obtain a clearer picture,  we employ  the fraction  as a binary 
bite measure,  dividing  regions  at the median  fraction.  In the robustness  
checks,  we also include  the fraction  as a continuous  variable.  𝑋 𝑗,𝑡 entails 
control variables  provided  by the INKAR database.  17 It comprises  of the 
regional  GDP per capita, the population  density,  the share of women,

trol for time persistent  regional  characteristics,  we employ  a ﬁxed eﬀect 
estimation  with robust standard  errors clustered  by region. 19 
The identifying  assumption  of the diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  approach  
that we employ  is that the treatment  regions  (i.e. high-bite  regions)  and 
control regions  (i.e. low-bite  regions)  have common  trends in the wage 
gap in the absence  of the treatment.  In order to test this, we estimate  
a placebo  regression  in Section  3.3 , assuring  us that the common  trend 
assumption  holds. However,  we ﬁrst turn to our main results in the fol- 
lowing section.  
3.2. Main results 
In our main analysis  we estimate  Eq. (1) described  in Section  3.1 with 
ﬁxed eﬀects. As already  done in Section  2.3 , we look at the wage gap 
at three diﬀerent  points of the distribution:  the 10th and the 25th per- 
centile as well as the mean. Accordingly,  our results are divided  with 
respect to these outcome  variables,  which is indicated  by the three dif- 
ferent panels in Table 2 . Within each panel, we include  the control vari- 
ables in six steps, captured  by columns  (1) to (6). The table shows the 
coeﬃcients  and indicates  their signiﬁcance.  
The ﬁrst panel estimates  the eﬀect on the gap at the tenth percentile.  
Without  the inclusion  of further control variables  (column  1), there is a 
strongly  signiﬁcant  treatment  eﬀect of − 5.2 percentage  points. This is to 
say that –in comparison  to regions  with a low bite in 2014 –high-bite  
regions  experience  a reduction  of the wage gap at the tenth percentile  of 
5.2 percentage  points in 2018, ceteris paribus.  This is accompanied  by 
a general  reduction  of the gap of 3.6 percentage  points between  2014 
and 2018. When we include  additional  control variables  iteratively,  the 
cent, the share of women with contracts  subject to social security contributions  among 
all women in working age, the share of children under three years in childcare  among 
all children under three, the share of children between three and six years in childcare  
among all children between three and six. 
19 Using arbitrary correlation  regressions  as proposed  by Colella et al. (2019) in order to 
incorporate  standard errors that account for spatial correlation  between the labour market 
regions does not change the signiﬁcance  of our results. magnitude  of the treatment  eﬀect only slightly  decreases  and the sig- 
niﬁcance  is unchanged.  In the most comprehensive  speciﬁcation  (col- 
umn 6), high-bite  regions  experience  a reduction  in the wage gap of 4.6 
percentage  points from 2014 to 2018 due to the minimum  wage. This 
corresponds  to a reduction  of about 32% in the wage gap (compared  to 
the level in 2014 which was 14.4% in these regions).  It is interesting  to 
note, that the signiﬁcance  of the dummy  for 2018 vanishes  after con- 
trolling  for the employment  rate of women,  meaning  that the wage gap 
for low-paid  employees  only reduced  for highly aﬀected  regions,  and 
very strongly  so. When looking  at the wage gap at the 25th percentile  
(see Panel B), the treatment  eﬀect is still highly signiﬁcant  but not as 
large. It ranges from − 2.8 to − 3.4 percentage  points depending  on the 
speciﬁcation.  In our preferred  speciﬁcation  (column  6) it corresponds  
to a relative  eﬀect of − 18% compared  to the level in 2014 (which was 
at 18.3%).  For the wage gap at the mean (Panel C), the eﬀects are least 
pronounced:  in the most comprehensive  speciﬁcation  (column  6), the 
signiﬁcant  treatment  eﬀect amounts  to − 2.3 percentage  points, corre- 
sponding  to a relative  reduction  of 11% (compared  to the 2014 level 
which was 20.4%).  The results suggest  that there was a general  reduc- 
tion of the wage gap at the mean between  2014 and 2018, but regions  
in which women  were particularly  aﬀected  by the minimum  wage ex- 
perienced  an additional  decrease.  
Overall,  the analysis  shows that there is a strong eﬀect of the mini- 
mum wage, which is especially  large at the bottom  of the wage distribu-  
tion. The gap at the tenth percentile  is reduced  by 4.6 percentage  points 
(32%) between  2014 and 2018 in regions  that were strongly  aﬀected  by 
the minimum  wage compared  with less aﬀected  regions.  Higher up in 
the distribution,  the magnitude  and signiﬁcance  of the results decrease.  
However,  an eﬀect can still be detected  and it ranges from 18% at the 
25th percentile  to 11% at the mean. 
3.3. Common  trend 
In order to analyse  the common  trend assumption,  we make use of 
the 2010 wave of the SES. However,  the structure  of the SES signif- 
icantly changed  between  2010 and 2014. In 2010, there were fewer

Note: ∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 1 , ∗∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 05 , ∗∗∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 01 . The table displays  the results of ﬁxed-eﬀects  estimations  in a 
diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  framework  with region-ﬁxed  eﬀects and robust standard  errors clustered  by re- 
gion. The minimum  wage bite is binary and the regions are the 257 Labour Market Regions.  In Panel A 
the dependent  variable  is the unadjusted  wage gap at the 10th percentile  of the regional  gender-speciﬁc  
wage distribution.  Accordingly,  in Panel B (C) the dependent  variable  is the gap at the 25th percentile  
(the mean). The reference  year is 2014. 
sectors included  and –most important  to our case –there were no ﬁrms 
with fewer than ten employees  subject to social security  contributions.  
Additionally,  the month of data collection  changed.  Overall,  there is 
information  on over 1.9 million  employees  in about 34,000 businesses  
included  in 2010, in comparison  to about one million  workers  in 60,000 
businesses  in 2014 ( Destatis,  2013; FDZ, 2019 ). Therefore,  given that we 
cannot simply compare  our previous  results to the 2010 data, we make 
use of a subsample  of ﬁrms, which we identify  via a variable  that is 
provided  by the federal statistical  oﬃce and that adapts the 2014 and 
2018 data to the structure  of the 2010 wave ( FDZ, 2019 ). This leads to 
a slightly  diﬀerent  subsample  in comparison  to our main analysis  (see 
Table A.1 ): here, a smaller  share of male and female employees  was 
aﬀected  by the introduction  of the wage ﬂoor. Accordingly,  the wages 
that they display  are higher. One reason for this is that the subsample  
does not include  ﬁrms with fewer than ten employees,  which usually  pay 
less. Additionally,  the gender wage gaps are slightly  diﬀerent  between  
the two samples.  However,  the two samples  are comparable  overall.  
In Table 3 we show the results of re-running  the Eq. (1) with our 
subsample  (columns  4 to 6) as well as the equation  adapted  to the pre- 
reform period (columns  1–3), which is deﬁned  as follows:  
𝐺𝑎𝑝 𝑗,𝑡 = 𝛼𝑟 + 𝛽𝑇 2014 
𝑡 + 𝛿𝑇 2014 
𝑡 𝐵 𝑖𝑡𝑒 2014 
𝑗 + 𝑋 𝑗,𝑡 + 𝜐𝑗,𝑡 , with 𝑡 = { 2010 , 2014 } 
(2) 
The table shows that when looking  at the time before the minimum  
wage introduction,  i.e. between  2010 and 2014, the wage gap evolved  
similarly  in high- and low-bite  regions,  which is indicated  by a statisti-  cally insigniﬁcant  interaction  term. This conﬁrms  our assumption  of a 
common  trend in the gap before the reform.  When turning  to the repli- 
cation of our main regressions  for the years 2014 and 2018 with the 
subsample,  we observe  very similar results to our main speciﬁcation  
presented  in Section  3.2 . Again, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant  eﬀects for the 10th 
and 25th percentile  that are also comparable  in magnitude.  However,  in 
contrast  to our main results in Table 2 , we do not ﬁnd a signiﬁcant  eﬀect 
for the mean gap. Nonetheless,  our results give us conﬁdence  that the 
common  trend holds and that the wage gaps would have developed  sim- 
ilarly in high- and low-bite  regions  in absence  of the reform,  especially  
for the lower parts of the distribution.  
3.4. Robustness  analysis  
In the following,  we will test the sensitivity  of our results to a number  
of practical  implementation  issues. We look at diﬀerent  computations  of 
the minimum  wage bite, the exclusion  of employees  working  in sectors 
with sector-speciﬁc  minimum  wages, diﬀerent  regional  classiﬁcations,  
a non-weighted  bite measure  and weighted  labour market regions.  
Diﬀerent  bite measures  First, we employ  other variations  of the bite 
measure.  As discussed  in Section  2.2 , our main analysis  relies on the 
ratio of aﬀected  female employees  in 2014 to all female employees  in 
2014. However,  we could also employ  the minimum  wage bite for all 
employees,  irrespective  of their gender.  We thus re-run the estimation  
using the overall fraction  (see Panel B in Table A.2 , Panel A repeats  the 
results of the main analysis  for comparison).  The results mirror those of

Note: ∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 1 , ∗∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 05 , ∗∗∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 01 . The table displays  the results of ﬁxed-eﬀects  estima- 
tions in a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  framework  with region-ﬁxed  eﬀects and robust standard  
errors clustered  by region. The minimum  wage bite is binary and the regions are the 257 
Labour Market Regions.  Columns  (1)–(3) include regressions  entailing  the years 2010 and 
2014, Columns  (4)–(6) show regressions  containing  the years 2014 and 2018. In Columns  (1) 
and (4) the dependent  variable  is the unadjusted  wage gap at the 10th percentile  of the re- 
gional gender-speciﬁc  wage distribution.  Accordingly,  in Columns  (2) and (5) the dependent  
variable  is the gap at the 25th percentile,  in Columns  (3) and (6) it is the gap at the mean. 
The reference  year is 2010 for Columns  (1)–(3) and 2014 for Columns  (4)–(6). The subsample  
is identiﬁed  via the variable  GG2010  , which is provided  by the federal statistical  oﬃce and 
which adapts the 2014 and 2018 data to the structure  of the 2010 wave ( FDZ, 2019 ). 
the full estimation  of our main analysis,  although  the eﬀects are not as 
large in magnitude.  This is caused by the fact that the fraction  of aﬀected  
employees  calculated  for women  only better identiﬁes  the regions  that 
are particularly  subject to reductions  in the wage gap. However,  regions  
where men are also highly aﬀected  are not expected  to experience  a 
pronounced  decrease  in the wage discrepancies.  A second bite variation  
that we employ  is the continuous  bite (see Panel C in Table A.2 ). In 
our main estimation,  we only distinguished  between  low-bite  and high- 
bite regions,  cut oﬀat the median  bite. Now we include  the fraction  of 
aﬀected  female employees  as a continuous  variable,  allowing  for more 
variation  in the treatment.  The variable  ranges from 3.8% to 55.8%. 
Again, the structure  of the results is rather similar to our main results,  
although  the interpretation  of the coeﬃcients  is slightly  diﬀerent.  Here, 
a ten-percentage-point  increase  in the bite corresponds  to a reduction  of 
the wage gap at the tenth percentile  by 3.3 percentage  points in 2018. 
Similarly,  the gap at the mean decreases  by 1.8 percentage  points. 
Excluding  sector-speciﬁc  minimum  wages The law stipulates  that em- 
ployees  in sectors with pre-existing  minimum  wages below €8.50 were 
exempted  from the wage ﬂoor until the end of 2016. Unfortunately,  we 
are not able to identify  these sectors in our data. Since these were only 
few sectors and regulations  ran out at the end of 2016, this should not 
aﬀect our results.  Nevertheless,  in order to test the robustness  of our 
results in that direction  we can exclude  all employees  subject to any 
sector-speciﬁc  minimum  wages (most of them were above €8.50, see 
Mindestlohnkommission,  2016b , for more details)  and re-run our esti- 
mation (see Panel D in Table A.2 ). 20 Again, the results are similar to the 
main estimation  and do not challenge  our results.  
Regional  classiﬁcations  Moreover,  we check the sensitivity  in terms of 
the regional  classiﬁcation.  In our main estimation,  we decided  to make 
use of the 257 labour market regions  since they supply more variation  
than the 96 planning  regions  and include  more observations  per region 
20 We thus exclude 98,076 men and 79,654 women in 2014 and 94,602 men and 71,567 
women in 2018. than the 401 districts.  In order to check whether  this decision  inﬂuences  
our results,  we now make use of these other regional  divisions  (see Pan- 
els E and F of Table A.2 ). The results are very similar to our main results,  
although  the eﬀects sizes are again slightly  smaller  and the treatment  
eﬀect at the mean becomes  insigniﬁcant.  However,  the eﬀects at the 
10th and 25th percentiles  are robust and mostly highly signiﬁcant.  
Additional  controls  As another  robustness  test we include  the regional  
economic  growth  rate of the GDP per capita into our regression,  in order 
to control for the fact that some regions  might have a better economic  
performance  and adjust diﬀerently  to the minimum  wage introduction.  
We use a four-year  interval  (i.e., the years between  𝑡 − 5 and 𝑡 − 1 which 
corresponds  to 2009 and 2013 as well as 2013 and 2017, respectively).  
Clearly,  this comes with the caveat that the second growth  rate might 
itself be aﬀected  by the minimum  wage introduction  and hence, results 
should be interpreted  cautiously.  Additionally,  we include  the regional  
unemployment  rate in 𝑡 − 1 to account  for changes  in the regional  labour 
market situation.  The results at the 10th and 25th are a little smaller  
compared  to our baseline  estimation,  whereas  the eﬀect at the mean is 
slightly  higher and increases  in signiﬁcance  (see Panel I of Table A.2 ). 
Weights  Finally,  we check whether  our results are sensitive  with re- 
spect to weighting  issues. First, we focus on the individual  weights  pro- 
vided by the Federal  Statistical  Oﬃce. As discussed  before, our main 
analysis  incorporates  individual  weights  when calculating  the minimum  
wage bite and the regional  wage distributions.  However,  these are de- 
signed to yield representative  results on the level of federal states. Since 
we run estimations  on a smaller  regional  level, we check whether  the 
inclusion  of those weights  inﬂuences  our results.  We therefore  re-run 
our estimation  without  them (see Panel H in Table A.2 ). Additionally,  
since our main analysis  does not include  regression  weights,  we now re- 
peat the analysis  using the regional  employment  in 2014 as estimation  
weights  (see Panel I in Table A.2 ). The results of both these sensitivity  
analyses  are in line with the previous  estimations,  yielding  very similar 
results compared  to our main regression.  
Overall,  our analyses  conﬁrm  the robustness  of our results for low- 
paid employees  with respect to diﬀerent  implementation  decisions  that

we made in our main estimation.  We can thus conclude  that there is 
a negative  and highly signiﬁcant  eﬀect of the minimum  wage on the 
gender wage gap at the bottom  of the distribution.  However,  for the 
gap at the mean, the results are not as robust. 
4. Conclusion  
The introduction  of the minimum  wage in Germany  was a major in- 
tervention  into the labour market,  which was –a m o n g  other things –
expected  to reduce poverty  and alleviate  inequality  ( Bosch, 2007; Min- 
destlohnkommission,  2016b ). One of the dimensions  that could be af- 
fected are gender wage diﬀerentials.  Germany  poses an interesting  re- 
search case, since it exhibits  both large wage gaps and a high minimum  
wage. In our paper, we have thus analysed  whether  the wage ﬂoor did 
indeed lead to a decrease  of the gender wage gap and –if so –at which 
point(s)  of the distribution.  For this purpose,  we employed  a regional  
diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  approach,  making  use of the regional  variation  
in the degree to which female employees  were aﬀected  by the mini- 
mum wage. Using comprehensive  data from the Structure  of Earnings  
Survey,  we identify  regional  wage gaps in 2014 and 2018 as well as the 
regional  fraction  of aﬀected  female workers.  Descriptively,  we observe  
a reduction  in the wage gap between  2014 and 2018 for the whole dis- 
tribution.  However,  we also see that it was particularly  reduced  among 
the low-paid  employees.  
In our diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  analysis,  we ﬁnd that there was a sig- 
niﬁcant  decrease  in the gender wage gap in regions  in which women  
were strongly  aﬀected  by the minimum  wage in comparison  to regions  
where women  were less aﬀected:  high-bite  regions  experience  a reduc- 
tion of the wage gap at the 10th percentile  of 4.6 percentage  points 
from 2014 to 2018 due to the minimum  wage, and this eﬀect is ro- 
bust across speciﬁcations.  The magnitude  of this eﬀect is large, corre- 
sponding  to a relative  reduction  of about 32% compared  to the level 
in 2014. When looking  at the bite in a continuous  deﬁnition,  we ﬁnd 
that increasing  a region’s  bite by ten percentage  points leads to a reduc- 
tion of the wage gap at the 10th percentile  by 3.3 percentage  points. 
Our placebo  estimations  show that there was no such eﬀect before the reform,  i.e. that the common  trend assumption  is reasonable.  Ad- 
ditionally,  we ﬁnd that these eﬀects fade out higher up the distribu-  
tion. For the gap at the 25th percentile,  the eﬀect still amounted  to 
− 18%, while for the mean it was smaller  ( − 11%) and not particularly  
robust. 
Overall,  our analysis  suggests  that the minimum  wage can be an ef- 
fective tool for reducing  the gender wage gap, especially  at the lower end 
of the wage distribution.  However,  we do not incorporate  employment  
eﬀects. As discussed  above, strongly  aﬀected  women  could be driven to 
quit or lose their jobs, which would artiﬁcially  reduce the gender wage 
gap. While previous  evaluation  studies do not ﬁnd strong evidence  for 
such an eﬀect, future research  should focus on this more thoroughly  
as it would undermine  the eﬀects on overall gender equality.  In this 
context,  it would also be interesting  to identify  whether  women  are 
pushed  more strongly  into the informal  sector, or whether  their jobs 
are more often endangered  by automation  and capital-labour  substitu-  
tion. Additionally,  it would be insightful  to determine  the long-term  
eﬀects on the gender wage diﬀerentials.  Thus far, we are restricted  to 
data from 2014 and 2018, which allows us to identify  a medium-term  
eﬀect but neglects  possible  long-run  adaptation  processes.  Moreover,  
while our survey period includes  the ﬁrst minimum  wage increase,  an 
analysis  of the subsequent  raises could also yield relevant  information.  
Finally,  it would be interesting  to disentangle  the eﬀects on the ad- 
justed gender wage gap as well, not least because  the distinction  be- 
tween the two is often a very essential  issue in the gender wage gap 
debate.

Note: ∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 1 , ∗∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 05 , ∗∗∗ 𝑝 < 0 . 01 . The table displays  the results of ﬁxed-eﬀects  estimations  in a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence  
framework  with region-ﬁxed  eﬀects and robust standard  errors clustered  by region. Control variables  are included  as in Table 2 
but not reported.  In the ﬁrst column of each panel the dependent  variable  is the unadjusted  wage gap at the 10th percentile  of the 
regional  gender-speciﬁc  wage distribution.  Accordingly,  in the second (third) column the dependent  variable  is the gap at the 25th 
percentile  (the mean). The reference  year for all estimations  is 2014. We adapt them main speciﬁcation  as follows: In Panel A we 
display the main results from Table 2 for comparison.  In Panel B employ the minimum  wage bite for all employees,  irrespective  
of their gender. In Panel C we use a continuous  fraction rather than a binary one. In Panel D we exclude individuals  working  in 
sectors with sector-speciﬁc  minimum  wage agreements.  Panel E and F do not rely on Labour Market Regions but Planning  Regions 
(E) and Districts  (F). In Panel G we include the regional  unemployment  rate in 𝑡 − 1 as well as the regional  growth rate of the GDP 
per capita from 𝑡 − 5 to 𝑡 − 1 as additional  controls  variables.  In Panel H we do not use individual  weights for calculating  the bite 
and the regional  wage distribution.  In Panel I we weight the regions in the regression  using the absolute  regional  employment  as 
weights.

People  versus  machines:  The impact  of minimum  wages  on automatable

We study the eﬀect of minimum  wage increases  on employment  in automatable  jobs –jobs in which employers  may ﬁnd it easier to substitute  machines  for people 
–f o c u s i n g  on low-skilled  workers  for whom such substitution  may be spurred by minimum  wage increases.  Based on CPS data from 1980 to 2015, we ﬁnd that 
increasing  the minimum  wage decreases  signiﬁcantly  the share of automatable  employment  held by low-skilled  workers,  and increases  the likelihood  that low-skilled  
workers  in automatable  jobs become nonemployed  or employed  in worse jobs. The average eﬀects mask signiﬁcant  heterogeneity  by industry  and demographic  group, 
including  substantive  adverse eﬀects for older, low-skilled  workers  in manufacturing.  We also ﬁnd some evidence  that the same changes  improve  job opportunities  
for higher-skilled  workers.  The ﬁndings  imply that groups often ignored in the minimum  wage literature  are in fact quite vulnerable  to employment  changes  and job 
loss because of automation  following  a minimum  wage increase.  
1. Introduction  
For decades,  economists  have studied  the eﬀects of the minimum  
wage on employees  in the United States. These studies have largely fo- 
cused on the employment  eﬀects for low-skilled  workers  –with the prin- 
cipal focus on teenagers.  Overall,  there is some controversy  regarding  
whether  disemployment  eﬀects exist, with some studies ﬁnding  no ef- 
fects, 1 although  with more –and more diverse  kinds of studies –ﬁnding  
evidence  of disemployment  eﬀects. 2 
In this study, we explore  the extent to which minimum  wages induce 
substitution  away from workers  whose jobs are more easily automated.  
For instance,  employers  may substitute  away from labor with technolog-  
ical innovations  –such as supermarkets  substituting  self-service  check- 
out for cashiers,  and assembly  lines in manufacturing  plants substitut-  
ing robotic arms for workers.  At the same time, ﬁrms may hire other 
workers  who perform  new tasks that are complementary  with the new 
technology.  For example,  a ﬁrm using more robots may hire individuals

views the very recent literature,  classifying  the kinds of studies that ﬁnd disem- 
ployment  eﬀects and the kinds that do not. to service,  troubleshoot,  and maintain  these new machines.  It seems rea- 
sonable  to expect that the workers  more likely to be replaced  following  
minimum  wage increases  are those who are low skilled,  earning  wages 
aﬀected  by increases  in the minimum  wage, while workers  who “tend ”
the machines  are higher skilled.  This suggests  that there is a potential  
for labor reallocation  away from jobs that are automatable  following  in- 
creases in the minimum  wage, that low-skilled  workers  in automatable  
jobs are particularly  vulnerable  to minimum  wage increases,  and that 
the net disemployment  eﬀects may be smaller  than the gross eﬀects that 
workers  in automatable  tasks experience.  3 , 4 
We choose to focus on automation  as it has been one of the dominant  
forces that has threatened  low-skilled  jobs in the United States in recent 
decades  ( Autor and Dorn, 2013; Autor et al., 2015 ), presumably  because

a number of ways besides culling jobs. Other channels  of adjustment  that have 
been explored  in the minimum  wage literature  include changes  in hours –where 
the empirical  evidence  is mixed (see Neumark  and Wascher,  2008 , p. 78), job 
amenities  (see Simon and Kaestner,  2004 ), prices (see Aaronson,  2001; Aaron- 
son et al., 2008; Lemos, 2008 ; and MaCurdy,  2015 ), and compression  of wage 
diﬀerentials  (see John et al., 1996 ; and Autor et al., 2016 ). 
4 In a recent paper, Basker et al. (2017) explore a diﬀerent  kind of substitution  
of technology  for labor (at least, the ﬁrm’s labor) that can occur in response  to a 
higher minimum  wage –namely,  substitution  of a customer’s  labor for a worker’s  
labor (in, e.g., a self-service  gas station, or using a bank ATM). They suggest that 
this kind substitution  may occur when low-skilled  labor becomes  expensive  and 
technology  enables labor replacement  in tasks that are not easy to automate.

Fig. 1. Low-skilled  jobs and the level of automation  over time 
Notes: We plot the average routine task intensity  for each year, as given by 
Eq. (1) . In this ﬁgure, the routine task intensity  variable  is standardized  to have 
a mean of zero and a standard  deviation  of one. 
of both technological  advances  and reductions  in the cost of technology  
that can substitute  for low-skilled  labor. As emphasized  by Autor and 
Dorn (2013) and Maarten  et al. (2014) , the hollowing  out of mid-skill  
occupations  has been a signiﬁcant  channel  through  which automation  
has aﬀected  the occupation  distribution  over time. However,  the ad- 
vancement  of technology  in industry  has also touched  the occupations  
in which low-skilled  individuals  work. This is illustrated  in Fig. 1 , which 
shows a clear downward  trend in the degree to which job tasks of low- 
skilled individuals  are automatable,  from 1980–2015.  5 There is also evi- 
dence that this was spurred  by computerization.  Autor et al. (2003) doc- 
ument that computer  adoption  is positively  correlated  with routine  task 
intensity.  These are the tasks that are most easily automatable,  and Au- 
tor et al. also document  a clear overall decline,  since 1960, in jobs that 
are relatively  intensive  in these tasks. Autor and Dorn (2013) show that 
computerization  in industry  has accelerated  over the last four decades,  
and this technology  diﬀused  faster into areas that have higher shares of 
automatable  employment.  Such evidence  suggests,  as we would expect, 
that ﬁrms choose to substitute  technology  for workers  as it becomes  
cheaper  for them to do so. 
The core idea or hypothesis  underlying  our analysis  is that minimum  
wage increases  have the potential  to spur the automation  of low-skilled  
jobs, via substituting  technology  for low-skilled  workers.  These mini- 
mum wages increases  raise the price of low-skilled  labor, increasing  the 
cost savings  from this substitution.  The main aim of our paper is to ex- 
plore this hypothesis,  and in so doing to provide  a richer understanding  
of how minimum  wage policies  have been shaping  the type of employ-  
ment held in the United States, within industries,  and for particular  de- 
mographic  and skill groups.  
Speciﬁcally,  we ﬁrst assess whether  the share of employment  that is 
automatable  declines  in response  to minimum  wage increases.  We focus 
on jobs that tend to be held by low-skilled  workers,  given that these are 
the jobs for which labor costs increase  the most in relative  terms fol- 
lowing a minimum  wage increase,  which can prompt  ﬁrms to substitute  
from people (low-skilled  ones, in particular)  towards  machines.  We com- 
plement  our analyses  of how the share of employment  in automatable  
jobs responds  to minimum  wage increases  with analyses  of employment  
impacts  for individual  workers,  estimating  whether  the probability  that 
a low-skilled  individual  working  in an automatable  loses their job is 
larger following  a minimum  wage increase.  We also explore  other im- 
pacts on low-skilled  workers,  as well as whether  job opportunities  im- 
5 Fig. 1 is based on a measure  of “routine  task intensity  ”( RTI ) discussed  below 
(see Eq. (1) ). prove for higher-skilled  workers  in the industries  where a high share of 
low-skilled  employed  was in automatable  jobs. 
Our analysis  is related to concurrent  research  by Aaronson  and Phe- 
lan (forthcoming)  , who, for the period 1999–2009,  analyze  the suscepti-  
bility of low-wage  employment  to technological  substitution  in the short 
run. Speciﬁcally,  they focus on regressions  that model the probability  of 
being employed  within the next two years against  measures  of the task 
content  in an individual’s  current  job. They ﬁnd that minimum  wage in- 
creases lead to job losses for cognitively-routine  jobs, but not manually-  
routine  or non-routine  jobs. Their study provides  some evidence  that 
ﬁrms may automate  routine  jobs in response  to a minimum  wage in- 
crease, reducing  employment  opportunities  for workers  in routine  jobs. 
Our study contributes  beyond  this analysis  in a number  of ways. 
First, while Aaronson  and Phelan (forthcoming)  are concerned  with an 
average  individual’s  job loss, we focus on quantifying  how shares in the 
employment  of automatable  tasks change following  a minimum  wage 
change,  to provide  more evidence  on how the task composition  of the 
workforce  is aﬀected.  Second,  we expect that automation  is a viable 
and likely substitute  for certain types of low-skilled  jobs, and therefore  
also certain types of low-skilled  labor, implying  that average  eﬀects may 
mask signiﬁcant  heterogeneity.  We therefore  attempt  to provide  a fuller 
picture of labor market adjustments  across industries  and a variety of 
demographic  groups,  which can uncover  these important  diﬀerential  re- 
sponses.  As discussed  below, this is of particular  interest  with respect to 
the broader  minimum  wage literature.  
Third, for those who lose their jobs to automation  following  a mini- 
mum wage increase,  we expect that the risk of not being able to ﬁnd a 
similar job is greater for some groups as compared  to others, and that 
an inability  to do so has longer-term  adverse  consequences  for earnings  
(and re-employment).  Hence, we also analyze  the eﬀects of minimum  
wage increases  on whether  particular  types of low-skilled  individuals  
working  in automatable  jobs are more or less likely to stay in the same 
“job ” (narrow  occupation  and broad industry)  following  a minimum  
wage increase.  Finally,  we extend the analysis  to cover more outcomes  
for low-skilled  workers,  and to assess eﬀects on higher-skilled  workers.  
Together,  our analyses  provide  the ﬁrst evidence  on how the shares 
of automatable  jobs change following  a minimum  wage increase,  and on 
the eﬀects of minimum  wages on groups that are very often ignored  in 
the minimum  wage literature,  such as eﬀects on older less-skilled  work- 
ers who are in jobs where it is easier to replace  people with machines.  
Our work is timely given that many U.S. states have continued  to 
regularly  raise their minimum  wages, and a large number  of additional  
states have newly implemented  minimum  wage laws (all higher than the 
federal minimum  wage), with a number  of states now indexing  their 
minimum  wages. As of January  7, 2017, 30 states (including  the Dis- 
trict of Columbia)  had a minimum  wage higher than the federal mini- 
mum wage of $7.25, ranging  as high as $11 in Washington  State, and 
$11.50 in the District  of Columbia.  6 Moreover,  many U.S. cities have 
implemented  minimum  wages, with the minimum  wage in Seattle (and 
nearby Sea-Tac)  already  reaching  $15. Policy debate regarding  these 
increases  frequently  references  the literature  on disemployment  eﬀects 
discussed  above (a literature  from which advocates  on either side can 
pick evidence  to support  their view). But this literature  largely focuses  
on teenagers,  for whom employment  eﬀects are either irrelevant,  or at 
best very tangentially  related,  to the more important  policy question  of 
whether  higher minimum  wages help low-income  families.  If employ-  
ment changes  in response  to higher minimum  wages mask larger gross 
eﬀects for subgroups  of low-skilled  workers  in automatable  tasks –and 
in particular  subgroups  ignored  in the existing  minimum  wage literature  
–t h e n the reliance  of policymakers  on evidence  for teenagers  may be 
ignoring  potentially  adverse  eﬀects for older workers  more likely to be 
major contributors  to their families  ’incomes.

Our empirical  analysis  draws on CPS data from 1980 to 2015. We 
distinguish  between  occupations  that are intensive  in automatable  tasks 
by drawing  on deﬁnitions  provided  in Autor and Dorn (2013) and 
Autor et al. (2015) . We calculate  for each industry  within each state- 
year cell an automatable  employment  share. 7 The core of our analysis  
links these measures  to changes  in the relevant  minimum  wage. 
Overall,  we ﬁnd that increasing  the minimum  wage decreases  signif- 
icantly the share of automatable  employment  held by low-skilled  work- 
ers. Our estimates  suggest  that the elasticity  of this share with respect to 
the minimum  wage is − 0.10. However,  these average  eﬀects mask sig- 
niﬁcant  heterogeneity  by industry  and by demographic  group. In partic- 
ular, there are large eﬀects on the shares of automatable  employment  in 
manufacturing,  where we estimate  an elasticity  of − 0.18. Within man- 
ufacturing,  the share of older workers  in automatable  employment  de- 
clines most sharply,  and the share of workers  in automatable  employ-  
ment also declines  sharply  for women  and blacks. 
Our analysis  at the individual  level draws many similar conclusions.  
We ﬁnd that a signiﬁcant  number  of individuals  who were previously  
in automatable  employment  are nonemployed  in the period following  
a minimum  wage increase.  These eﬀects are relatively  larger for indi- 
viduals  employed  in manufacturing,  and are larger for the oldest and 
youngest  workers,  for females,  and for blacks. Overall,  this analysis  
points to important  heterogeneity  in the employment  eﬀects of min- 
imum wages – including  some potentially  positive  eﬀects for higher-  
skilled workers  in jobs where the minimum  wage spurs substitution  
away from low-skilled  workers  in automatable  jobs. Moreover,  our ev- 
idence highlights  potentially  adverse  consequences  of higher minimum  
wages for groups of workers  that have not typically  been considered  in 
the extensive  research  literature  on the employment  eﬀects of minimum  
wages. Thus, a main message  from our work is that groups often ignored  
in the minimum  wage literature  are in fact quite vulnerable  to employ-  
ment changes  and job loss because  of automation  following  a minimum  
wage increase.  
2. Analysis  of shares of employment  in automatable  jobs 
2.1. Methods  
Most of our analysis  focuses  on low-skilled  individuals,  who we de- 
ﬁne as having a high school diploma  equivalent  or less. We use data from 
Autor and Dorn (2013) and Autor et al. (2015) to measure  routine  task 
intensity  ( RTI ) in jobs held by low-skilled  workers.  These authors  use 
RTI as a proxy for determining  the degree to which the tasks within an 
occupation  are automatable.  The use of measures  of routine  tasks from 
the Dictionary  of Occupation  Titles , to construct  this kind of proxy for 
automatable  employment,  was ﬁrst introduced  by Autor et al. (2003) . 
In particular,  routine  task intensity  in each three-digit  occupation  is de- 
ﬁned as follows:  
𝑅𝑇 𝐼 𝑘 = 𝑙 𝑛 (𝑇 𝑘 𝑅 )− 𝑙 𝑛 (𝑇 𝑘 𝑀 )− 𝑙 𝑛 (𝑇 𝑘 𝐴 )(1) 
where T k R , T k M , and T k A are the levels of routine,  manual,  and abstract  
task inputs for occupation  k . 8 Routine  tasks involve  a repeated  sequence  
of actions,  are easily codiﬁable,  and are therefore  substitutable  with 
technology.  In contrast,  manual  tasks require  actions that are not gener- 
ally predictable  in sequence,  so substitution  with technology  is limited.  
To provide  some examples,  blue-collar  jobs that are highly routine  
include  machinists  and typesetters.  Jobs with low routine  task intensity  
include  bus driving  and service station occupations.  Blue-collar  jobs that 
are classiﬁed  as high on manual  task intensity  include  taxi drivers,  oper- 
ating agents of construction  equipment,  and drivers of heavy vehicles,  
7 We actually  distinguish  between  urban and non-urban  areas within each 
state. 
8 These levels are deﬁned using variables  from versions  of the Dictionary  of 
Occupation  Titles , where incumbents  are asked to grade the level of their occu- 
pation with respect to particular  attributes.  while meat cutters and upholsterers  are low on this domain.  Abstract  
tasks require  high-level  thinking  that is complemented  by technology  
( Autor and Dorn, 2013 ). Examples  of low-skilled  jobs that are high on 
abstract  task intensity  include  supervisors  of motor vehicle transporta-  
tion, railroad  conductors,  and production  foremen.  Jobs that are low on 
abstract  task intensity  are garbage  collectors,  parking  lot attendants,  and 
packers.  Thus, Eq. (1) is increasing  in the absolute  and relative  quantity  
of tasks that are automatable  within occupation  k . 
We further calculate  for each industry  i , within each area a (deﬁned  
as states divided  into urban and nonurban  areas), in year t , a routine  
employment  share, as follows:  
𝑅𝑆 𝐻 𝑖𝑎𝑡 = ( 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 (𝐿 𝑖𝑎𝑡 )⋅1 [𝑅𝑇 𝐼 𝑘 > 𝑅𝑇 𝐼 𝑃66 ]) ( 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 (𝐿 𝑖𝑎𝑡 )) −1 
. (2) 
In Eq. (2) , L iat is equal to total employment  in industry  i in area a 
at time t . 1[.] is an indicator  function  equal to one if an occupation  is 
in the top third of the employment-weighted  distribution  of RTI across 
occupations  ( RTI P66 denotes  the 66th percentile),  using only low-skilled  
workers.  The numerator  is then the share of automatable  low-skill  em- 
ployment  in a particular  industry,  area, and year, and the denominator  
is total low-skilled  employment  in that industry,  area, and year. 
Our analysis  initially  focuses  on the following  speciﬁcation:  
𝑅𝑆 𝐻 𝑖𝑎𝑡 = 𝑏 1 𝐿𝑜𝑔 (𝑀 𝑊 𝑠𝑡 )+ 𝐴 𝑎 𝛾+ 𝑇 𝑡 𝜆+ 𝜀 𝑖𝑎𝑡 , (3) 
where MW st denotes  the minimum  wage in state s at time t . We use the 
log of minimum  wages following  the literature  on minimum  wages in the 
last decade or more. Eq. (3) also includes  area ( A a ) and year ( T t ) ﬁxed 
eﬀects. Area is deﬁned  as state-speciﬁc  dummy  variables  interacted  with 
whether  the area is urban area or not. Negative  and signiﬁcant  estimates  
of b 1 would imply that the share of employment  that is automatable  
declines  in response  to minimum  wage increases.  9 
We next turn to disaggregating  these eﬀects across industries  and 
demographic  groups,  to see whether  there are sectors or groups particu-  
larly vulnerable  to automation  in response  to minimum  wage increases.  
In other work, diﬀerential  patterns  of task reallocation  have been doc- 
umented  across demographic  groups.  For example,  less-educated,  male, 
and young workers  have been the most susceptible  to reductions  in em- 
ployment  that is intensive  in routine  tasks ( Autor and Dorn, 2013; Autor 
and Dorn, 2009 ). We therefore  focus on diﬀerences  in eﬀects by age and 
sex, and we also examine  diﬀerences  by race. 10 Speciﬁcally,  for race we 
look at whites and blacks (we do not look at other categories  given small 
cell sizes), and for age we look at those aged 40 and over, those aged 
25 or younger,  and the intermediate  group aged 26–39. 
To unpack  the impact of minimum  wage increases  by age, sex, and 
race, we use measures  of task intensity  for each subgroup  (indexed  by 
c ), as follows:.  11 
𝑅𝑆 𝐻 𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑡 = ( 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 (𝐿 𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑡 )⋅1 [𝑅𝑇 𝐼 𝑘 > 𝑅𝑇 𝐼 𝑃66 ]) ( 𝐾 ∑
𝑘 =1 (𝐿 𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑡 )) −1 
. (4) 
In this case the numerator  is the share of automatable  employment  
held by a subgroup  in a speciﬁc  industry,  area, and year, and the denom-  
inator is total employment  of a subgroup  by industry,  area, and year. We 
9 We also augmented  Eq. (3) adding up to three lags of the minimum  wage 
variable.  The inclusion  of lags allows for a period of adjustment  to reorganize  
the factors of production  away from labor and towards  capital investments  in 
technology  (and perhaps other complementary  labor). In all models, the lags 
were not signiﬁcant,  suggesting  that investment  in technology  is relatively  fast. 
As we discuss later, however,  the minimum  wage is deﬁned based on the average 
minimum  wage in the current and past 11 months,  itself averaged  over the year, 
so that the absence of lagged eﬀects still allows eﬀects that can arise over nearly 
two years. 
10 The minimum  wage literature  also has many of examples  of papers that 
consider  variation  in employment  eﬀects across subgroups  –for example,  gender 
( Dube et al., 2016 ), age ( Giuliano,  2013 ), and ethnicity  ( Allegretto  et al., 2011 ). 
11 RTI k and RTI P66 are computed,  as before, for all low-skilled  workers.

estimate  Eq. (3) for the separate  subgroups,  indexed  by c , using RSH as 
deﬁned  in Eq. (4) . 
There are two main sources  of tasks that are routine  intensive.  The 
ﬁrst are tasks found in blue-collar  manufacturing  occupations  that are 
also capital intensive.  For example,  automobiles  are most often pro- 
duced using conveyor  belts. Workers  perform  tasks within this assem- 
bly line, which are routine  and substitutable  with robotic arms. The 
second is codiﬁable  administrative-support  tasks that are typical to the 
inputs required  in the ﬁnancial  services  industries,  among others ( Autor 
and Dorn, 2013; Autor et al., 2015 ). The variation  across industries  in 
the proportion  of individuals  that are working  in automatable  employ-  
ment, among low-skilled  workers,  is reported  in column  (1) of Table 1 . 
Finance,  retail, manufacturing,  and public administration  ( “P. Adm. ”) 
have particularly  high shares of low-skilled  workers  doing automatable  
tasks. 
We expect the minimum  wage to change the share of employment  
in automatable  tasks in diﬀering  degrees  for particular  industries.  The 
impact directly  relates to how dominant  an automatable  task type is 
among low-skilled  in the industry  in question,  and the ease and cost 
of automating  tasks. To uncover  whether  there are diﬀerential  eﬀects 
by industry  we estimate  Eq. (3) separately  by one-digit  industry,  in the 
aggregate  (using RSH as deﬁned  in Eq. (2) ), and by demographic  group 
(using RSH as deﬁned  in Eq. (4) ). 
2.2. Data 
Our main data source for the analysis  of employment  shares is pooled 
monthly  CPS samples  from 1980 to 2015. These data are matched  to 
monthly  state-level  data on the minimum  wage. 12 We allow for a pe- 
riod of adjustment  by deﬁning  the minimum  wage as the average  over 
the current  month plus the last 11 months.  In addition,  we do not in- 
clude agriculture  and mining in our subgroup  analysis  by industry,  as 
we cannot meaningfully  or reliably  calculate  RSH iat in many states or 
areas with a low representation  of these industries.  We then create our 
share of employment  variable  on a yearly basis. 13 
We rely on crosswalks  provided  by Autor and Dorn (2013) and Dorn 
(2009) to convert  occupation  codes in the CPS to a consistent  coding 
12 These minimum  wage data are available  at https://www.socsci.uci.  
edu/ ∼dneumark/datasets.html  . 
13 This choice is made for statistical  reasons given that cell sizes are too small 
for accurate  calculation  of RSH iat on a monthly  basis, especially  for some indus- 
tries and demographic  groups. This level of analysis  is also more intuitive  given 
that automation  requires  some period of adjustment.  system across years. 14 RTI , described  in Eq. (1) , is provided  by Autor and 
Dorn (2013) and is matched  to the CPS data using this coding system.  As 
noted earlier,  we use data on low-skilled  individuals  with a high school 
diploma  equivalent  or less. 
3. Individual-level  analysis  
3.1. Methods  
Even if the share of automatable  jobs declines  for low-skilled  work- 
ers (per the prior analysis),  employment  opportunities  need not decline  
if these workers  are reallocated  to non-automatable  jobs. We therefore  
also estimate  regressions  using individual-level  data on low-skilled  in- 
dividuals  to explore  whether  job prospects  worsen  for those low-skilled  
workers  who were in routine  jobs when the minimum  wage increases.  
Speciﬁcally,  we estimate  the model: 
𝐸𝑚 𝑝 𝑗𝑖𝑎𝑖 +1 = 𝑏 1 ⋅𝑅𝑆 𝐻 𝑗𝑖𝑎𝑡 ⋅𝐿𝑜𝑔 (𝑀𝑊 𝑠𝑡 )+ 𝑏 2 𝑅𝑆 𝐻 𝑗𝑖𝑎𝑡 + 𝑇 𝑡 ⋅𝐴 𝑎 𝜆+ 𝜀 𝑗𝑖𝑎𝑡 , 
(5) 
where Emp is the probability  that the j th person is employed  in industry  
i , area a , at time t + 1. It is assigned  zero if a person was nonemployed  
in t + 1 . The sample consists  of those employed  in period t , and either 
employed  or nonemployed  (i.e., unemployed  or not in the labor force) 
in period t + 1 . 
Eq. (5) relates this job loss to workers  having held a routine  job 
in period t , and faced a minimum  wage increase,  with the coeﬃcient  
b 1 on the interaction  RSH jiat ·Log(MW  st ) capturing  whether  a person in 
automatable  work is more vulnerable  to job loss following  a minimum  
wage increase,  compared  to those not in automatable  work. Note that 
the minimum  wage and the routine  share ( RSH ) are measured  in period 
t , and the employment  transition  is measured  from period t to period 
t + 1 . 15 All control variables  are also measured  at time t . We can only 
14 Speciﬁcally,  we follow Lordan and Pischke (2016) and match the currently  
relevant  Census occupation  code system (1980, 1990, 2000 or 2010) to the rel- 
evant Autor and Dorn crosswalk.  This gives us a consistent  coding system that 
can be matched  directly to our measure  of automatable  tasks. 
15 One might want to measure  RSH prior to when the minimum  wage is mea- 
sured, to avoid contemporaneous  changes  associated  with the minimum  wage. 
But we do not have longer lagged information  on employment  with which to 
lag the measurement  of RSH.

look at those initially  employed  because  we need to classify  jobs by RTI ; 
hence, we capture  only ﬂows out of employment.  16 
Eq. (5) also includes  a full set of area-by-year  interactions  (where 
area is deﬁned  by state and urban or nonurban  areas within states), to 
allow ﬂexibly  for diﬀerential  yearly shocks to states and subareas  of 
states. 17 Given the inclusion  of the area-by-year  interactions,  the main 
eﬀect Log( MW st ) drops out of the equation,  and identiﬁcation  of the 
coeﬃcient  on the interaction  comes from variation  in the availability  of 
automatable  jobs within areas across time. 18 
All other deﬁnitions  are consistent  with Eqs. (1) through  (4) . If in- 
dividuals  working  in automatable  jobs at the time of a minimum  wage 
increase  are more likely to lose jobs by the next period, compared  to in- 
dividuals  aﬀected  by the same minimum  wage increase  but who are in 
jobs that are not automatable,  we would expect the coeﬃcient  on b 1 to 
be negative.  As in the share analysis,  we explore  heterogeneity  in b 1 by 
estimating  Eq. (5) separately  by industry  and by demographic  subgroup.  
We complement  these regressions  with analyses  that consider  a de- 
pendent  variable  that equals one if an individual  had the same narrow  
occupation  code (3-digit)  and broad industry  code (1-digit)  in the in- 
terview  year, and zero otherwise  (including  both the nonemployed  and 
“job ” switchers).  In these analyses,  b 1 < 0 would reﬂect transitions  to 
other employment  or to nonemployment  –with the former presumably  
reﬂecting,  to some extent, movements  of out of employment  in automat-  
able tasks following  a minimum  wage increase.  
3.2. Data 
We estimate  Eq. (5) using data from the Annual  Social and Economic  
Supplement  (ASEC)  of the CPS. We focus only on individuals  with a high 
school diploma  equivalent  or less, as in our shares analysis.  The ASEC 
ﬁles are useful for our purposes  because  they include  information  on the 
occupation  and industry  of the job held by respondents  in the previous  
year, which is period t in the analysis  described  above. Thus, RSH is 
based on this occupation.  Columns  (2) and (3) of Table 1 report the 
average  probabilities  that employed,  low-skilled  workers  in automatable  
jobs remain employed,  or in the same “jobs ”(for those who remain in 
the labor force). 
4. Identiﬁcation  
A potential  issue in estimating  the eﬀects of minimum  wages is 
whether  minimum  wage variation  is correlated  with shocks to low-skill  
labor markets  –possibly  due to endogenous  policy –in which case we 
may not identify  causal eﬀects of minimum  wages. This issue has arisen 
prominently  in recent exchanges  on the employment  eﬀects of minimum  
wages; see, most recently,  Allegretto  et al. (2017) and Neumark  and 
16 We cannot investigate  models with lags or additional  leads as we do not 
know where the individual  was working  beyond two periods.  
17 We cannot allow this much ﬂexibility  in the share analysis  because this is the 
level at which the minimum  wage variation  arises in that analysis.  In contrast,  
here we can because we are interested  in the eﬀect of the interaction  between  
RSH and the minimum  wage. 
18 We cannot meaningfully  document  the overall eﬀect of minimum  wages on 
wages of those in automatable  work, since this would restrict us only to those 
who are employed  in both periods,  and because the main eﬀect of the minimum  
wage is subsumed  in the ﬁxed eﬀects. Moreover,  we do not necessarily  expect 
a larger wage eﬀect for those in automatable  work; the substitution  response  
may simply be larger. We did verify that in models for wages, the estimate  of 
b 1 is negative  and signiﬁcant.  Assuming  (as in past work) that minimum  wages 
on average raise wages of low-skill  workers,  this suggests  that the pay increase  
induced  by a higher minimum  wage for those in automatable  work is not as 
high as for those in non-automatable  work, which ﬁts the story that automation  
reduces demand  for those in automatable  tasks and may increase  demand  for 
workers  with diﬀerent  (and likely higher) skills. Wascher  (2017) . 19 However,  we are estimating  eﬀects on a subgroup  
of low-skilled  workers,  and it seems less plausible  that policy is chosen 
endogenously  with respect to outcomes  for one subgroup  of low-skilled  
workers.  Moreover,  our individual-level  analysis  is even more insulated  
from this identiﬁcation  issue, because  we control in an unrestricted  fash- 
ion for yearly shocks to states, and their urban and nonurban  areas sepa- 
rately. This approach  of isolating  the eﬀects of minimum  wages control-  
ling for state or substate  shocks has been advocated  by Allegretto  et al. 
(2011) and Dube et al. (2010) . While this approach  may raise other con- 
cerns (see Neumark  et al., 2014a ), it does have the virtue of potentially  
controlling  for shocks to low-skilled  labor markets  that are correlated  
with minimum  wage changes.  
Finally,  evidence  of leading  minimum  wage eﬀects could provide  ev- 
idence that minimum  wage changes  respond  to expected  future changes,  
in which case our evidence  may not be causal. We can assess this evi- 
dence for our share analysis,  which is based on a panel on observations  
on areas and industries  over time. We estimated  versions  of Eq. (3) al- 
lowing up to three annual leading  terms; these were never statistically  
signiﬁcant,  and were centered  around zero. 
5. Results  
5.1. Eﬀects on employment  shares 
The results from our share of employment  analyses  ( Eq. (3) ) are re- 
ported in Table 2 . In the aggregate  across all industries,  as shown in 
column  (1), we ﬁnd that minimum  wage increases  cause a statistically  
signiﬁcant  reallocation  of labour away from automatable  tasks. We ﬁnd 
that a 10% increase  in the minimum  wage leads to a 0.31 percentage  
point decrease  in the share of automatable  jobs done by low-skilled  
workers,  implying  an elasticity  of − 0.10. 20 
When we look separately  by industry,  the estimated  eﬀects in con- 
struction,  wholesale,  retail, ﬁnance,  and public administration  are small, 
centered  around zero, and not statistically  signiﬁcant.  In contrast,  the 
eﬀects are larger for manufacturing,  transport,  and services,  and sig- 
niﬁcant  at the 5% or 10% level for manufacturing  and transport.  For 
example,  the estimates  imply that the elasticity  of the share of automat-  
able jobs among low-skilled  workers  in manufacturing  with respect to 
the minimum  wage is − 0.18. 
Table 3 presents  our analysis  of the eﬀects of the minimum  wage on 
the share of employment  in automatable  jobs, broken down by demo- 
graphic  group and (in columns  (2)–(9))  by industry.  The estimates  point 
to signiﬁcant  heterogeneity  in these eﬀects beyond  the diﬀerences  by 
industry  documented  in Table 2 . For example,  a higher minimum  wage 
signiﬁcantly  reduces  the shares of low-skilled  workers  in automatable  
jobs for all three age groups (only at the 10% level in two cases), but the 
magnitudes  are larger for the youngest  and oldest workers.  Looking  by 
both age and industry,  for older workers  ( ≥ 40 years old) the negative  
eﬀect mainly arises in manufacturing,  retail, and public administration,  
while for younger  workers  ( ≤ 25 years old) the eﬀects are large in many 
sectors,  but the estimate  is close to zero in manufacturing,  and statis- 
tically signiﬁcant  only in services.  For the middle age group (26–39)  
there is a sizable estimated  decline  in manufacturing,  but it is well un- 
der one-half  the eﬀect for older workers.  Thus, older workers  appear 
more vulnerable  to substitution  away from automatable  jobs in man- 
ufacturing  when the minimum  wage increases.  Moreover,  the general  
adverse  eﬀect of the minimum  wage for older jobs in automatable  jobs 
19 Recent work by Clemens  and Wither (2016) and Baskaya  and Rubinstein  
(2015) indicates  that, if anything,  the employment  eﬀects are more negative  
when accounting  for correlated  shocks, suggesting  that policy variation  is cor- 
related with positive shocks. 
20 We do not include industry  ﬁxed eﬀects in the pooled estimates,  so that we 
can detect changes  in the share of employment  in automatable  jobs arising from 
industry  reallocation.  However,  the estimates  including  industry  ﬁxed eﬀects 
were very similar.

is interesting  in light of the typical focus of the minimum  wage literature  
–and the evidence  of disemployment  eﬀects –on very young workers.  
On average,  females  are aﬀected  more adversely  than males: in the 
aggregate  estimates  in column  (1), the estimate  is negative  and signif- 
icant only for females,  and is ten times larger, indicating  that, for fe- 
males, a 10% increase  in the minimum  wage reduces  the share of au- 
tomatable  jobs (among  the low-skilled)  by 0.78 percentage  point (an 
elasticity  of − 1.53). Across industries,  these negative  eﬀects for females  
are concentrated  in manufacturing,  services,  and public administration.  
For males, none of the industry-speciﬁc  estimates  are statistically  signif- 
icant, but the estimated  eﬀects are negative  and sizable for manufactur-  
ing and retail. 
Table 3 also points to more adverse  eﬀects on the share in au- 
tomatable  employment  for blacks than for whites,  with the eﬀect more 
than double for blacks. 21 However,  the eﬀects are heterogeneous  across 
industries.  There are sizable adverse  estimated  eﬀects for whites in 
manufacturing,  transport,  services,  and public administration,  although  
21 The implied elasticities  − 0.22 and − 0.10 respectively.  only the transport  estimate  is statistically  signiﬁcant.  For blacks, there 
are much larger, and statistically  signiﬁcant,  decreases  in automatable  
shares in manufacturing  and transport.  22 
22 We have run the state-level  results in Tables 2 and 3 with state-speciﬁc  linear 
trends. We should note that, based on other work in the minimum  wage litera- 
ture (e.g., Neumark  and Wascher,  2017 ), there is too much emphasis  placed on 
this kind of speciﬁcation  check. As Meer and West (2016) have shown, it can be 
quite tricky to deﬁne the counterfactual  with linear tends. Moreover,  over long 
sample periods,  the linear restriction  is typically  unjustiﬁed,  and linear trends 
imposed  over long periods can lead to nonsensical  results (like outcomes  that 
must be positive becoming  negative).  Finally, we can end up substantially  re- 
ducing the identifying  information.  As shown in the on-line appendix,  when we 
add state-speciﬁc  linear trends, the point estimates  are generally  consistent  with 
what is reported  in Tables 2 and 3 , although  the increases  in standard  errors tend 
to make the estimated  eﬀects insigniﬁcant  (although  not always).  Finally, note 
that in the individual-level  analysis  we are able to add state-by-urban-by-year  
ﬁxed eﬀects, which completely  subsume  any area-speciﬁc  trends (which are just 
restricted  versions  of arbitrary  state-by-year  ﬁxed eﬀects). This is an important  
advantage  of the individual-level  analysis.

5.2. Eﬀects on remaining  employed  23 
The evidence  discussed  thus far indicates  that higher minimum  
wages lead to substitution  away from labor doing routine  tasks, among 
low-skilled  workers.  However,  the decline  in the share of employment  
in automatable  tasks may be accompanied  by reallocation  of these low- 
skilled workers  to less routine,  less automatable  tasks. Still, it seems un- 
likely that job prospects  would not have worsened  for low-skilled  work- 
ers in the aggregate,  assuming  that to some extent jobs with less routine,  
less automatable  tasks are higher skilled.  
To study whether  a higher minimum  wage increases  transitions  to 
nonemployment  among low-skilled  workers  who were in jobs with rou- 
tine tasks, Table 4 reports estimates  of Eq. (5) , which models the eﬀects 
of minimum  wage increases  on the probability  a particular  individual  
who holds an automatable  job is still employed  in the next period. 
Overall,  we ﬁnd evidence  indicating  that the negative  eﬀects on em- 
ployment  shares in automatable  jobs reported  in Tables 2 and 3 are 
associated  with job loss and transitions  to nonemployment  among low- 
skilled workers  who were initially  doing automatable  jobs. Looking  
across industries  in the pooled estimates  in column  (1), we ﬁnd evidence  
(signiﬁcant  at the 10% level) of a decline  in the probability  of remain-  
ing employed  –a n d hence an increase  in the probability  of becoming  
nonemployed.  The − 0.001 estimate  translates  into a small elasticity  of 
the probability  of a transition  to nonemployment  with respect to the 
23 As in the employment  shares analysis,  we focus here on a dummy indicating  
whether  or not a person is in automatable  employment.  We carried out similar 
analyses  to those in this subsection,  but using a continuous  measure  of RTI . 
The overall conclusions  are generally  qualitatively  similar and in some cases 
stronger.  minimum  wage, − 0.013. 24 Examining  the results by industry,  there is 
some correspondence  between  the results in Tables 4 and 2 . For exam- 
ple, the decline  in the probability  of remaining  employed  is large in 
manufacturing,  and is sizable (and signiﬁcant  at the 10% level) for ser- 
vices. Of course, we do not necessarily  expect a tight correspondence  
between  the two types of results across industries,  as the possibilities  
for reallocating  low-skilled  workers  from automatable  jobs may vary by 
industry.  There appears  to be a tighter correspondence  between  the re- 
sults by demographic  group, with the evidence  in Table 4 pointing  to 
stronger  eﬀects on job loss for younger  workers  and black workers.  
In Table 4 , the estimates  in columns  (2)–(9) for the second row and 
below report results disaggregating  by both industry  and demographic  
group. One interesting  results is that, in manufacturing,  there are ad- 
verse employment  eﬀects for both the oldest and youngest  groups of 
workers  in automatable  jobs, with implied  declines  in the probability  of 
employment,  from a 10% minimum  wage increase,  of 0.25 and 0.22 per- 
centage  point, respectively.  The implied  elasticities  of the probability  of 
becoming  nonemployed  are − 0.28 for older workers  in manufacturing,  
and − 0.17 for younger  workers  in manufacturing.  Again, this evidence  
points to subsets of workers  who are not typically  considered  in the min- 
imum wage literature,  yet who are vulnerable  to job loss from higher 
minimum  wages. Note, also, that within manufacturing,  the adverse  ef- 
fect on employment  arises for women,  but not for men, and there is 
statistically  signiﬁcant  evidence  of job loss for whites,  but not blacks 
(although  the point estimate  is larger for blacks).  On the other hand, 
24 In computing  these elasticities  for the estimates  of Eq. (5) , note that we use 
the baseline  proportion  who become nonemployed  (or, in Table 5 , change jobs); 
these are one minus the types of mean probabilities  shown in columns  (2) and 
(3) of Table 1 .

Notes: See notes to Tables 2 and 4 . Dependent  variable  is equal to 1 if a person is employed  in the same 3-digit occupation  and 
1-digit industry  in t + 1, and 0 if they are nonemployed  or not in the same “job. ”
looking  by industry,  the estimates  point to larger job loss eﬀects for 
blacks in transport,  wholesale,  retail, ﬁnance,  and services  (although  
the estimates  for the latter two industries  fall well short of statistical  
signiﬁcance).  
5.3. Eﬀects on job switching  
Table 5 reports estimates  of the same speciﬁcation,  but redeﬁning  
the dependent  variable  to equal to one if an individual  stayed in the 
same “job ”i n the subsequent  period, and zero otherwise.  A person is 
deﬁned  as being in the same job in t + 1 if they have the same 3-digit 
occupation  code and 1-digit industry  code. As in Table 4 , the sample 
is restricted  to those employed  in period t ; in addition,  those employed  
must have valid occupation  codes. Thus, the estimated  eﬀect of the min- 
imum wage-routine  interaction  captures  the change in job opportunities  
in the worker’s  initial occupation  and broad industry,  with a “decline  ”
captured  in either non-employment  or a change of jobs. 
Overall,  there are many additional  larger, signiﬁcant,  and negative  
eﬀects reported  in Table 5 , suggesting  that higher minimum  wages lead 
to a good deal of job switching  among low-skilled  workers  in automat-  
able jobs, in addition  to transitions  to nonemployment;  this job switch-  
ing is presumably  another  cost of higher minimum  wages for these work- 
ers. In addition,  the evidence  of such eﬀects within industries  suggests  
there is substantial  reallocation  of labor within industries  because  of the 
minimum  wage increase.  
Turning  to some speciﬁc  magnitudes,  the overall pooled estimate  
of − 0.0213 implies  an elasticity,  with respect to the minimum  wage, of 
the probability  of changing  or losing one’s job of − 0.15. Across indus- 
tries, the eﬀect is negative  and signiﬁcant  in manufacturing,  transport,  
wholesale,  ﬁnance,  services,  and public administration.  The estimate  is 
positive  only in retail. By demographic  group, the adverse  eﬀects are, as in Table 4 , larger for the youngest  and oldest workers.  Interestingly,  
once we include  job switching  as well as transitions  to nonemployment,  
as we do in Table 5 , the evidence  of adverse  eﬀects for white work- 
ers becomes  more pronounced,  and arises in every industry  but retail. 
In contrast,  when we looked only at transitions  to nonemployment,  in 
Table 4 , the evidence  of adverse  eﬀects for whites was much weaker.  
This, again, suggests  that negative  eﬀects of minimum  wages for low- 
skill workers  in automatable  jobs arise for groups that have not been the 
focus of traditional  work on the employment  eﬀects of minimum  wages. 
5.4. Transitions  to low-wage  industries  
A natural  follow-on  question  is whether  individuals  who are in au- 
tomatable  employment  who switch jobs because  of minimum  wage 
increases  are more likely to end up in speciﬁc  industries.  Autor and 
Dorn (2013) argue that workers  displaced  from automatable  jobs tend 
to move to the retail and services  sectors.  To explore  the evidence  in the 
context  of minimum  wage eﬀects, we can re-estimate  Eq. (5) . We restrict 
the sample to those employed  in period t , as before, but also to those 
employed  only in industries  aside from retail or services.  We then deﬁne 
the dependent  variable  to equal one if a person moves to the retail or ser- 
vices industry  in t + 1, and zero if they remain employed  in an industry  
outside  these two sectors;  in the top panel, those nonemployed  in period 
t + 1 are also coded as zero. Thus, b 1 > 0 in Eq. (5) (the coeﬃcient  on 
the interaction  RSH jiat ·Log(MW  st ) ) implies  that a higher minimum  wage 
pushes low-skilled  workers  who were in automatable  jobs into the retail 
or services  sectors.  The results reported  in Table 6 indicate  that this is 
the case for both retail and services  –whether  considered  separately  or 
together.

of column (1), the sample is those employed,  but not in retail, in period 
t ; the dependent  variable  is equal to 1 if the person is employed  in retail 
in t + 1, and zero otherwise.  
5.5. Hours eﬀects 
Our analysis  so far has focused  on employment.  However,  there is 
also a potential  for hours in automatable  work to decrease  following  a 
minimum  wage increase.  We consider  hours explicitly  by re-estimating  
Eq. (3) using as the dependent  variable  the share of hours worked  among 
low-skilled  workers  in automatable  employment.  We also re-estimate  a 
version  of Eq. (5) , for the diﬀerence  between  an individual’s  usual hours 
worked  in year t + 1 and year t . In this case, we focus only on those who 
are employed  in the two periods,  with positive  hours worked,  to focus 
on the intensive  margin response.  
The results of this analysis  to some extent parallel  the employment  
share results in Table 3 and the employment  transition  results in Table 4 . 
The pooled estimates  in the top panel of Table 7 imply that a minimum  
wage increase  of $1 causes a 0.15 percentage  point decrease  in the share 
of hours in automatable  jobs done by low-skilled  workers  overall (an 
elasticity  of − 0.05), although  this estimate  is not statistically  signiﬁcant.  
However,  as for employment,  there is a much larger negative  eﬀect in 
manufacturing.  We also ﬁnd larger hours share reductions  for women  
and for blacks, paralleling  the ﬁndings  in Table 3 , and large hours share 
reductions  for older workers.  
The individual-level  analysis  is reported  in the lower Panel of 
Table 7 . The data for both periods  are recalled  in the same interview  
period. The samples  are smaller  than in Table 4 because  we only in- 
clude individuals  who kept their jobs between  the two periods.  There 
is also loss due to non-response  on the “hours worked  last year ”ques- 
tion. The estimates  suggest  signiﬁcant  decreases  in hours worked  for 
those initially  in automatable  jobs following  a minimum  wage increase.  
Based on the pooled estimate,  a 10% increase  in the minimum  wage 
generates  a 0.16 decrease  in hours worked  for low-skilled  individuals  
who held an automatable  job in the previous  period –a small but sta- 
tistically  signiﬁcant  eﬀect. The estimated  decline  is negative,  typically  
larger, and statistically  signiﬁcant  in construction,  manufacturing,  trans- 
port, wholesale,  ﬁnance,  services,  and public administration  (in the last 
case only at the 10% level). Overall,  the results indicate  that those in au- 
tomatable  low-skilled  work are vulnerable  to hours reductions  following  
a minimum  wage increase.  Across demographic  groups,  the estimated  
coeﬃcients  are mostly signiﬁcant  and negative.  The estimated  hours 
reductions  are larger for older workers  and the middle age group, for 
males versus females,  and for whites versus blacks. 5.6. Are the eﬀects stronger  in more recent data? 
It is interesting  to re-estimate  these models using a shorter,  more 
recent time period, at the risk of losing observations,  given that the 
move towards  automation  has likely accelerated  over time, as technol-  
ogy has been getting cheaper,  and labor more expensive.  To this end, in 
Table 8 we report estimates  covering  1995–2016,  rather than going back 
to 1980. (We do not report estimates  by industry  crossed  with demo- 
graphic  subgroups.)  Comparisons  with Tables 2–5 reveal that the over- 
all estimates  are generally  stronger  in the more recent subperiod.  This 
suggests  that the substitution  response  to minimum  wages was higher in 
more recent years, likely because  of increased  ease of automation  (and 
perhaps  minimum  wages reaching  higher levels).  
Moreover,  the qualitative  pattern  across industries  and demographic  
groups often remains  similar,  although  not always.  For example,  we still 
ﬁnd large negative  estimates  for manufacturing  and transport,  although  
the manufacturing  estimate  is attenuated  slightly  relative  to Table 2 . 
One diﬀerence  is that in Table 8 , there is a considerably  larger nega- 
tive estimated  eﬀect for public administration  (marginally  signiﬁcant),  
which could be related to more recent diﬀusion  of personal  computers  
into this industry.  
Looking  at demographic  subgroups,  one striking  diﬀerence  is the 
sharper  adverse  eﬀect of minimum  wages on remaining  employed  (or 
employed  in the same job) for older workers.  This estimated  negative  
eﬀect is largest for older workers  in Table 8 (in both the middle and 
lower panels),  but not in Tables 4 or 5. The implication  is that, in more 
recent years, the adverse  eﬀect of minimum  wages on employment  for 
those in automatable  jobs has become  relatively  worse for older work- 
ers, which could reﬂect a combination  of a lower likelihood  of retaining  
a job in the automatable  subset of jobs, or a lower ability or willingness  
to make a transition  to a non-automatable  job. 
One potential  concern  with comparing  results across sample periods  
is that who gets only a high school diploma  or less is changing  over time, 
with people achieving  higher levels of education  in more recent years. 
Therefore,  there is a risk that negative  selection  into our deﬁnition  of 
the low-skilled  also partially  explains  the strengthening  of the results 
in the most recent time period. However,  the most important  concern  
would be if this selection  is associated  with changes  in the minimum  
wage; based on other research,  we regard this as unlikely.  25 
5.7. Probing  the eﬀects in manufacturing  
Returning  to Tables 3–5 , many of our results by industry  point to de- 
clines in the share of automatable  jobs, and increased  job loss, in man- 
ufacturing.  These types of ﬁndings  are unusual  in the minimum  wage 
literature,  which usually  focuses  on very low-skilled  workers  (hence the 
emphasis  on teenagers,  for example,  and retail or restaurant  workers).  
Then again, our analysis  does not focus on manufacturing  in the aggre- 
gate, but on low-skilled  workers  in automatable  jobs. Nonetheless,  if 
the eﬀects we estimate  in manufacturing  are in fact driven by minimum  
wage increases,  they should be generated  from low-wage  rather than 
high-wage  workers.  
To that end, we estimate  our key results for higher-wage  and lower- 
wage workers  in the manufacturing  industry,  based on wages in occupa-  
tions within manufacturing.  For each low-skill  occupation  within manu- 
25 Some past research  suggests  that minimum  wages may lower schooling,  pos- 
sibly by drawing  some workers  out of school and into full-time  work, displacing  
from the job market high school dropouts  who are already working  ( Neumark  
and Nizalova,  2007; Neumark  and Wascher,  2003 ). Newer work, however,  ﬁnds 
little evidence  of such an eﬀect ( Neumark  and Shupe, 2018 ). Note also that many 
of our interesting  and in some ways novel results refer to workers  who –unlike  
much past minimum  wage research  –a r e not teenagers  or young adults, for 
whom any such schooling  response  is likely to be largely non-existent.

jobs in manufacturing  arising from low-wage  jobs. Speciﬁcally,  the coef- 
ﬁcient estimates  for the high-wage  regressions  are small, almost never 
statistically  signiﬁcant,  and centered  around zero. In contrast,  the co- 
eﬃcients  in the models for low-wage  jobs are uniformly  negative,  and 
often sizable and statistically  signiﬁcant.  For example,  the pooled esti- 
mates for low-wage  occupations  are negative  and statistically  signiﬁcant

of employment  and the probability  of remaining  employed  (the middle

5.8. Eﬀects on higher-skilled  workers  
We might expect that as the minimum  wage reduces  jobs for low- 
skilled workers  in automatable  jobs, it could also increase  jobs for 
higher-skilled  workers  who “tend ”t h e machines.  For instance,  going 
27 We consider  an alternative  deﬁnition  based on industry,  in which for each 
low-skill  sub-industry  (at the two-digit  level) within manufacturing,  we compute  
average wages from the 1980 to 2016 Merged Outgoing  Rotation  Group ﬁles of 
the CPS. The low-wage  sub-sample  is the bottom tertile of industries  in this dis- 
tribution,  and the high-wage  subsample  is the top tertile. These deﬁnitions  are 
again matched  to the data used for the previous  analyses.  The results are shown 
in Appendix  A . Compared  to Table 10 , the results are quite similar. One diﬀer- 
ence is that, in this case, the stronger  statistical  evidence  of adverse eﬀects on 
the probability  of remaining  in the same job, by demographic  subgroup  (e.g., for 
the oldest and youngest  workers,  and for women),  is often slightly attenuated,  
although  the overall conclusions  are the same. back to our manufacturing  analysis,  operators  can be replaced  with 
robotic arms, but the robotic arms need maintenance  and troubleshoot-  
ing. 
We explore  this in Table 11 . We estimate  the same speciﬁcation  as 
in Eq. (5) , with the only diﬀerence  being that we deﬁne the dependent  
variable  (and hence the sample)  for higher-skilled  workers.  We continue  
to deﬁne routine  work for low-skilled  workers,  so that we obtain a par- 
allel analysis  to the earlier analysis  in Tables 4 and 5 , but now asking 
whether  the interaction  of the minimum  wage with a higher share of 
routine  work for low-skilled  workers  –which  reduces  job opportunities  
for them –at the same time increases  job opportunities  for higher-skilled  
workers.  The estimates  in the top panel of Table 11 are for the proba- 
bility of remaining  employed  (as in Table 4 ), and the estimates  in the 
bottom  panel are for the probability  of remaining  employed  in the same 
job (as in Table 5 ). 
The evidence  indicates  that job opportunities  are improved  for 
higher-skilled  workers.  Nearly every estimated  coeﬃcient  in Table 11 is 
positive,  and the estimates  are often sizable and in some cases statis- 
tically signiﬁcant.  For example,  in the top panel, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant  
positive  eﬀects for the youngest  workers  and those aged 26–39, and in 
the bottom  panel we ﬁnd signiﬁcant  (or marginally  signiﬁcant)  positive

Notably,  we do not ﬁnd evidence  of a positive  eﬀect for older higher-skill  
workers  in either panel, perhaps  because  the kinds of job opportunities  
opened  up by automation  require  skills that these older workers  are less 
likely to have or obtain. 
6. Conclusions  
This study empirically  assesses  whether  there is labor reallocation  
away from automatable  employment  following  increases  in the mini- 
mum wage, and how this reallocation  aﬀects the type of employment  
held in the United States, overall,  within industries,  and for particular  
demographic  groups.  We focus speciﬁcally  on jobs that tend to be held 
by low-skilled  workers,  for which labor costs increase  the most in re- 
sponse to minimum  wage increases.  We estimate  the impact of minimum  
wage increases  on the share of low-skilled  employment  in automatable  
jobs, and on the probability  that a low-skilled  individual  working  in an 
automatable  job stays employed  (or stays employed  in the same job). 
We explore  and document  considerable  heterogeneity  in these eﬀects 
across demographic  groups,  and across industries.  The analysis  goes be- 
yond the types of workers  usually  considered  in the conventional,  long- 
standing  research  on the employment  eﬀects of minimum  wages, such 
as teenagers  –studying,  for example,  the eﬀects of minimum  wages on 
older less-skilled  workers  who are in jobs where it is easier to replace  
people with machines,  and on manufacturing  workers  in such jobs. 
Based on CPS data from 1980 to 2015, we ﬁnd that increasing  the 
minimum  wage decreases  signiﬁcantly  the share of automatable  em- 
ployment  held by low-skilled  workers.  The average  eﬀects mask sig- 
niﬁcant  heterogeneity  by industry  and demographic  group. For exam- 
ple, one striking  result is that the share in automatable  employment  
declines  rather sharply  for older workers  –a n d within manufacturing,  
most sharply  for this age group. An analysis  of individual  transitions  
from employment  to nonemployment  (or to employment  in a diﬀer- 
ent job) leads to similar overall conclusions.  The heterogeneous  adverse  
eﬀects we document  indicate  that some groups typically  ignored  in the 
minimum  wage literature  are in fact quite vulnerable  to job loss be- 
cause of automation  following  a minimum  wage increase.  At the same 
time, we ﬁnd that some of the adverse  employment  eﬀects among low- skilled workers  in automatable  jobs are oﬀset by increased  employment  
opportunities  for higher-skilled  workers,  likely because  automation  of 
low-skilled  work creates other kinds of jobs. 
Our work suggests  that sharp minimum  wage increases  in the United 
States in coming  years will shape the types of jobs held by low-skilled  
workers,  and create employment  challenges  for some of them. Given 
data limitations,  we cannot address  the permanence  of the eﬀects. How- 
ever, the decision  to use labor-saving  technology  seems likely to be rel- 
atively permanent,  especially  if –as is becoming  increasingly  common  
–minimum  wages are indexed  so that a minimum  wage increase  results 
in permanently  higher relative  costs of low-skilled  labor ( Sorkin, 2015 ). 
We have followed  the deﬁnitions  of automatable  work as provided  
by Autor and Dorn (2013) . These are very useful deﬁnitions  for a ret- 
rospective  analysis,  given that the occupations  identiﬁed  as automat-  
able are highly credible.  However,  in the future many more occupa-  
tions that employ  low-skill  workers  are on track to be automated,  even 
if they are not currently  labeled  as ‘automatable.  ’These include,  for ex- 
ample, taxi drivers,  28 cashiers,  29 and bricklayers.  30 Therefore,  it is im- 
portant  to acknowledge  that increases  in minimum  wages will give in- 
centives  for ﬁrm to adopt new technologies  that replace  workers  earlier.  
While these adoptions  undoubtedly  lead to increased  job opportunities  
for some workers  –for which we ﬁnd some evidence  –it is likely that 
there are workers  who will be displaced  that do not have the skills to do 
the new tasks. We have identiﬁed  workers  whose vulnerability  to being 
replaced  by machines  has been ampliﬁed  by minimum  wage increases.  
Such eﬀects may spread to more workers  in the future.

29 There is increasing  use of innovations  in app technology  that allow cus- 
tomers to help themselves  to the products  they need, pay online and never see 
a cashier or checkout.  This technology  has already been adopted  for low-value  
purchases  in Apple Stores and in Amazon  GO (Amazon’s  new grocery store).

We investigate  the unemployment  effects of the minimum  wage policy in Russia, focusing  on possible  reasons 
for the heterogeneity  of the effects documented  in previous  literature.  Using region-level  data, we show that the 
policy increases  both the unemployment  rate among young workers  and the rate of informality.  We corroborate  
these findings  by leveraging  a sudden increase  in the minimum  wage in Kamchatka  as a natural experiment.  
Next, we show that the magnitude  of employment  responses  to minimum  wage changes  depends  on the 
elasticity  of capital-labor  substitution,  with stronger  effects observed  in industries  where capital and labor 
are more substitutable.  When substitution  is not feasible,  employers  respond  to the policy by hiring workers  
informally.  Consistent  with revealed  separations  and informal  recruitment,  we find limited income effects of 
the policy. These findings  highlight  the importance  of accounting  for existing production  technologies  and the 
extent of non-compliance  when raising the wage floor.
1. Introduction
The minimum  wage continues  to be a controversial  policy tool. 
Some studies show that the policy reduces  income  inequality  by raising 
the bottom  tail of the income  distribution  while the disemployment  
effect is either absent or negligible  (e.g., Katz and Krueger , 1992 ; Dube 
et al., 2010 ; Draca et al., 2011 ; Giuliano , 2013 ; Cengiz et al., 2019 ). 
Other studies show that higher labor costs destroy  jobs; therefore,  the 
minimum  wage policy potentially  harms rather than protects  workers  
(e.g., Neumark  and Wascher , 2010 ; Meer and West , 2016 ; Clemens  and 
Wither , 2019 ). A nascent  strand of literature  shows that the minimum  
wage could even have a positive  impact on employment.  In a perfectly  
competitive  labor market,  the elasticity  of labor demand  with respect  
to the minimum  wage is non-positive.  However,  higher labor-market  
concentration,  with monopsony  being an extreme  case, can result in 
increased  employment  following  a minimum  wage hike. For example,

1Studies also show that labor-market  concentration  affects wages directly (e.g., Bassanini  et al., 2024 ) and moderates  the impact of minimum  wages on 
self-employment  (e.g., Glasner,  2021).Azar et al. (2024 ) show that employment  responds  positively  to a 
higher minimum  wage in U.S. counties  characterized  by sufficiently  
high labor-market  concentration.1
In addition  to labor-market  concentration,  two additional  forces — 
the focus of this paper — may moderate  the effect of the minimum  
wage on unemployment.  First, the existence  of an informal  labor sector 
can act as a buffer, allowing  firms to bypass the wage floor by em-
ploying  workers  off the books. A key feature of such employment  is its 
invisibility  to local legislators,  which allows firms to retain workers  by 
paying below the minimum  wage. Second,  the substitutability  between  
capital and labor, i.e., the shape of the two-input  production  isoquant,  
may influence  how firms respond  to higher labor costs. In industries  
where capital and labor are easily interchangeable,  firms may opt to 
substitute  labor with capital,  exacerbating  the disemployment  effects of

a higher wage floor. Conversely,  in sectors where capital-labor  substi-
tution is not feasible,  the minimum  wage may lead to less pronounced  
disemployment  effects.
This paper investigates  the aforementioned  possibilities  in the con-
text of the minimum  wage policy in Russia. Four key findings  emerge.  
First, the policy does not affect the overall unemployment  rate, but it 
has a small positive  impact on the unemployment  rate among workers  
under 30. Second,  the share of informally  employed  workers  responds  
positively  to a higher minimum  wage. Third, job separations  among 
young workers  are concentrated  in industries  that can substitute  capital 
for labor more easily. Fourth,  consistent  with job losses among young 
workers  and the increased  informalization  of the labor market,  the 
minimum  wage policy has minimal  capacity  to increase  household  
income.  Altogether,  these findings  suggest  that incompliance  — man-
ifested by employers’  ability to recruit workers  informally  — and 
strong complementarity  between  labor and capital may explain  the lack 
of detectable  disemployment  effects from the minimum-wage  policy 
observed  in some past studies.
We estimate  the unemployment  effects of minimum  wages by ex-
ploiting  two different  empirical  designs.  First, we fit a two-way  panel 
fixed-effects  model of the regional  unemployment  rate, accounting  
for potential  reverse  causality  between  the local minimum  wage and 
the outcome  variable.  The Russian  institutional  context  provides  a 
plausibly  valid instrumental  variable  (IV): Bodman’s  Winter Severity  
Index, which quantifies  human perception  of winter severity  (Bodman , 
1916 ). The choice of the instrument  stems from the observation  that 
labor unions bargain  for higher wages when winter ‘‘feels’’ harsher  
than in the past. Our results show that a 1% increase  in the regional  
real minimum  wage increases  the unemployment  rate among workers  
aged below 30 by 0.05 percentage  points. This estimate  aligns with 
the lower end of minimum  wage effects reported  in the literature.  To 
further validate  our findings,  we rule out obvious  channels  through  
which our proposed  instrument  may affect the regional  unemployment  
rate. Consistent  with most past studies,  our analysis  finds no impact of 
the minimum  wage on older workers  (e.g., Portugal  and Cardoso , 2006 ; 
Neumark  et al., 2014 ).
We substantiate  these findings  by exploiting  a sizable (63%) in-
crease in the minimum  wage in the Kamchatka  region, following  the 
long tradition  of investigating  the unemployment  effects of the min-
imum wage policy in quasi-experimental  frameworks.2 We leverage  
this unexpected  minimum  wage increase  in Kamchatka,  comparing  its 
employment  trends with those in the geographically  adjacent  control  
region: Chukotka.  Our findings  suggest  that workers  younger  than 30 
faced a three-percentage-point  higher probability  of unemployment  
following  the 63% increase  in the local minimum  wage. Differently  
put, a 1% increase  in Kamchatka’s  minimum  wage increased  the unem-
ployment  rate among young workers  by approximately  0.05 percentage  
points, a result strikingly  comparable  to that obtained  from the region-
level data. Additionally,  we show that workers  in Kamchatka  were 
more likely to be employed  informally  after the wage floor was raised.
We next examine  cross-industry  heterogeneity  in the employment  
effects of the minimum  wage among youth. Our analysis  shows that 
younger  workers  are more likely to face separations  in industries  
where capital and labor are more easily substitutable.  These findings  
align with one of the Hicks–Marshall  laws of derived  demand,  which 
predicts  that the wage elasticity  of labor demand  is higher when 
other production  inputs can replace  workers  (Allen , 1938 ; Hamermesh , 
1993 ). Furthermore,  industries  with little or no employment  declines  
in response  to the minimum  wage hike tend to employ  more workers  
informally.  These results suggest  that employers’  ability to substitute  
2Kamchatka,  located in Russia’s  Far East, is known for its remote, sparsely  
populated  terrain and geographic  isolation  from much of the country.  As 
detailed  in Section 3, it has a geographically  adjacent  region that serves as 
a natural candidate  for the comparison  group.capital for labor and hire workers  off the books are two key factors 
moderating  the employment  effects of the minimum  wage policy.
Finally,  we assess whether  the Russian  minimum  wage policy aids 
the bottom  tail of the country’s  income  distribution  by replicating  
Dube’s (2019) analysis  of U.S. data. Our results show that the policy’s  
capability  to aid economically  disadvantaged  families  in Russia is, at 
best, limited.  Job losses and informal  recruitment  are two revealed  
labor-market  responses  that limit the minimum  wage policy’s  ability 
to raise the incomes  of the poorest.
Our findings  contribute  to several strands  of minimum  wage liter-
ature. First, they help explain  the disparities  in estimated  employment  
effects across generations  of studies.  For example,  Cengiz et al. (2019 ) 
utilize a long panel of U.S. states and report no overall employment  
effects, while Harasztosi  and Lindner  (2019 ) document  minimal  em-
ployment  effects in Hungary.  These findings  differ from earlier studies 
that suggest  higher minimum  wages harm employment  (e.g., Sabia 
et al., 2012 ; Neumark  et al., 2014 ). While such disparities  are often 
attributed  to differences  in empirical  specifications  (e.g., Allegretto  
et al., 2011 , 2017 ), our results suggest  that cross-country  and tem-
poral differences  in labor-market  characteristics,  such as capital-labor  
substitutability  and informality,  also play a significant  role.
Second,  we contribute  to the literature  on firms’ adjustments  to 
higher minimum  wages. In their comprehensive  review,  Dube and Lind-
ner (2024 ) discuss various  adjustments  highlighted  in the literature,  
including  reductions  in fringe benefits,  firm exit, price increases,  input 
cost reductions,  and profit declines.  In this regard,  the most relevant  
studies to our paper examine  changes  in capital investments  in response  
to higher wages (Chen , 2019 ; Harasztosi  and Lindner , 2019 ; Hau et al., 
2020 ; Baek et al., 2021 ). Relatedly,  Lordan and Neumark  (2018 ) show 
that automatable  jobs are particularly  vulnerable  to minimum  wage 
hikes. However,  some studies report either no effect or the opposite  
finding  (e.g., Haepp and Lin, 2017 ; Gustafson  and Kotter , 2018 ). Our 
results suggest  that these discrepancies  can be partly explained  by 
industry-level  differences  in production  isoquants.
Finally,  our results expand  on the literature  linking growing  in-
formality  as a response  to minimum  wages. Studies  show that non-
compliance  with minimum  wage laws limits the policy’s  effective-
ness in Colombia  (Pérez , 2020 ), Ecuador  (Wong , 2019 ), Honduras  
(Ham , 2018 ), and Indonesia  (Comola  and Mello , 2011 ). Our find-
ings suggest  that informal  recruitment  increases  with higher minimum  
wages, particularly  where the possibility  of capital-labor  substitution  is 
limited.
The remainder  of this paper is organized  as follows.  Section  2 
introduces  the institutional  context  and describes  the data. Section  3 
discusses  our empirical  strategies.  Section  4 presents  the unemployment  
effects of the minimum  wage. Section  5 investigates  its income  effects. 
Section  6 concludes.
2. Institutional  context  and data
2.1. Minimum  wage policy in Russia
The Russian  minimum  wage policy shares at least two features  with 
that of the United States. More specifically,  first, Russia updates  its 
wage floor regularly.  However,  federal subjects  (regions  henceforth)  
have the right to set their minimum,  which must be no lower than 
the national  level, and Fig.  1 shows the dynamics  of the monthly  
nominal  minimum  wage for full-time  workers  by region and month 
between  2009 and 2012 (83 regions).  Second,  with the exception  of 
seven regions,  the Russian  minimum  wage does not vary within a 
given region in a given period.3 In six of the seven exceptional  cases, 
3There are 26 regions that have the national  minimum  wage above the 
national  one at least at one point in time within our study period. Figure 
A1 of the Online Appendix  A shows the dynamics  of minimum  wage in four 
categories  of regions,  with the first (the last) category  having the highest 
(lowest)  level of the average minimum  wage in our study period.Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

the difference  is either between  the public and private sectors (Altai 
Krai, Kurgan  Oblast, Kursk Oblast, Tula Oblast, and Tyumen  Oblast)  or 
among the public, private,  and agricultural  sectors (Volgograd  Oblast).  
Among  these six regions,  the largest wage difference  between  public 
and private sector workers  is 45%, to the detriment  of the public sector 
(Tula Oblast, in 2012). In the remaining  region, Karelia,  the minimum  
wage varies across cities, favoring  workers  in colder areas.
We obtain data on the regional  minimum  wage from publicly  avail-
able trilateral  agreements  involving  the government,  labor unions,  and 
employers’  associations.  For the aforementioned  seven regions,  where 
the minimum  wage varies by sectors and/or by cities, we proceed  as 
follows.  In six regions  with sector-specific  wage floors, we construct  
a weighted  average  minimum  wage, using the share of workers  in 
each sector as weights.  In the region with city-specific  wage floors, 
we weight the minimum  wage by the share of the population  in each 
city. The data needed  to construct  sectoral  or city-level  weights  is 
publicly  available  from the Russian  Federal  Statistics  Service.  Finally,  
we collapse  the minimum  wages to the region-year  level.
To understand  the relative  size of the Russian  minimum  wage, 
it is useful to compare  the minimum-to-average  wage ratio in the 
country  — a variant  of the Kaitz index — with its values observed  in 
countries  frequently  appearing  in the literature.  For example,  in 2012, 
the Russian  Kaitz index was 0.28.4 This value is slightly  higher than 
that of the United States (0.27) during the same period,  as reported  by 
the International  Labor Organization,  but considerably  lower than in 
other countries  frequently  mentioned  in the minimum  wage literature,  
such as Canada  (0.4), Hungary  (0.4), and the United Kingdom  (0.39). 
In the following  section,  we describe  three key features  of the dynamics  
of minimum  wages that are relevant  to our econometric  identification:  
(i) substantial  cross-regional  differences  in minimum  wage levels; (ii) 
4The authors’  calculations  using the data obtained  from the Federal 
Statistics  Service.a tendency  for colder regions  to have higher wage floors, on average;  
and (iii) the introduction  of new minimum  wages typically  occurring  
in the first quarter  of the year.
First, as illustrated  in Fig.  1, significant  disparities  exist in minimum  
wage levels across regions.  This heterogeneity  is, in part, a result of 
varying  living costs among regions.  For instance,  Moscow,  known as the 
most expensive  city in Russia, has the highest  wage floor. On average,  it 
surpasses  the federal minimum  wage by 4.2 sample standard  deviations  
over the entire study period.
Second,  besides  the living cost, another  important  factor influencing  
the variations  in both the level and growth  of regional  minimum  wages 
is the local winter weather.  Specifically,  in colder regions,  workers  
have historically  received  higher minimum  wages. This phenomenon  
can be attributed  to the past implementation  of the Northern  Multiplier  
policy, designed  to compensate  individuals  for working  under extreme  
weather  conditions.  Consequently,  in several regions,  particularly  in 
the North and Far East, employers  were previously  mandated  to pro-
vide minimum  wages equal to the state-level  wage floor multiplied  
by a region-specific  multiplier.  This multiplier  ranged from 1.15 to 2 
and remained  in effect until 2007. As a result of the historical  pres-
ence of the Northern  Multiplier,  the minimum  wage in some regions  
consistently  exceeded  the national  level. For example,  three regions  
with wage floors just below Moscow’s  are Yamalo-Nenets,  Nenets,  and 
Khanty-Mansiysk  Autonomous  Okrugs,  all of which belong to Northern  
Russia.
Region-specific  minimum  wages are established  through  trilateral  
negotiations  involving  government  representatives,  labor unions,  and 
employers’  associations.  For instance,  business  representatives  may 
propose  that the government  refrain from increasing  the minimum  
wage if the local unemployment  rate is on the rise in a particular  region. 
Conversely,  labor unions advocate  for supporting  workers  during severe 
winter conditions,  even in areas where the Northern  Multiplier  has 
never been applied  (e.g., Southern  Russia).  The link between  win-
ter severity  and the proposed  minimum  wage level is mediated  by Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

compensation  for harsh working  conditions.  Consequently,  one may 
observe  an increase  in wage floors in certain regions  where no other 
economic  factors,  such as steeply rising current  consumer  prices or a 
low recent unemployment  rate, could justify high minimum  wages.5 
This observation  is central to our baseline  analysis,  which we elaborate  
on in Section  3.
Lastly, as Fig.  1 shows, new minimum  wages are typically  intro-
duced at the beginning  of the year. This observation  likely makes the 
introduction  of the new minimum  wage in the middle of the year less 
anticipated  by employers.  Based on this conjecture,  as a robustness  
check, we investigate  whether  unemployment  responds  to a plausibly  
unexpected  sharp minimum  wage increase  in Kamchatka,  which is 
one of the Russian  regions  that suddenly  increased  its wage floor by 
about 63% in the middle of the year—we  elaborate  further on this in 
Section  3.2.
2.2. Data
Regional  Characteristics .—Our investigation  begins with an analysis  
of regional  unemployment  rates. We obtain regional  indicators,  includ-
ing the overall unemployment  rate, age-specific  unemployment  rates 
(categorized  into three age groups:  15–19, 20–29, and 30+), and the 
proportion  of the labor force engaged  in informal  employment,  from 
the ‘‘Regional  statistics’’  section of the Russian  Federal  Statistics  Ser-
vice’s portal. The Russian  Federal  Statistics  Service  defines  individuals  
working  in the informal  sector as those employed  during the reporting  
period in an informal  enterprise.  An informal  enterprise  is defined  as 
an organization  that produces  goods and services  for market sale but 
lacks the legal status of a corporate  entity. The key feature of informal  
employment  relevant  to our study is its operation  outside  official 
oversight.  Consequently,  the minimum  wage floor is, in principle,  not 
binding  in such labor arrangements.
We also collect regional  data on real GDP per capita, consumer  
price index, working-age  population,  health-related  metrics  (such as 
the regional  pupil-to-doctor  ratio and per capita disease  rates), net 
migration  inflow, agricultural  output normalized  by GDP, electricity  
production,  and average  household  utility expenses  from the same 
data source.  Additionally,  we retrieve  nominal  minimum  wages from 
trilateral  agreements  involving  labor unions,  employers’  associations,  
and the government.  Finally,  we obtain data on temperature  and wind 
speed from the Hydrometeorological  Centre of Russia. Our dataset  
contains  the full set of variables  for the years 2009 to 2012. Table  1 
presents  summary  statistics.
To investigate  the relationship  between  industry-level  elasticity  of 
substitution  and the employment  effects of the minimum  wage, we 
collect additional  data on employment  indicators  (including  youth 
and informal  employment),  capital investments,  average  wages, and 
value-added  per worker  for each region-industry-year  cell from the 
same state’s statistics  service.  Additionally,  we use two survey datasets,  
which are publicly  available  from the ‘‘Federal  Statistical  Surveys  on 
Socio-Demographic  Issues’’ section of the Russian  Federal  Statistics  
Service’s  portal, as detailed  below.
Russian  Labor Force Survey, 2010–2013 .—To test the robustness  of 
our baseline  findings  from the regional  data, we conduct  a further 
investigation  of one region’s  higher minimum  wage introduction  using 
the Russian  Labor Force Survey (RLFS).  Conducted  by the Russian  
State Statistics,  the RLFS surveys  approximately  70,000 people from 
5Examples  include Kemerovo  Oblast in southwestern  Siberia, Leningrad  
Oblast in the European  part of Russia, Krasnodar  Krai in Southern  Russia, 
and Ivanovo  Oblast in the Central Federal District.  None of these regions,  due 
to their geographic  location,  has ever been subject to the Northern  Multiplier  
policy, yet their minimum  wages have consistently  remained  above the federal 
floor.Table 1

provided  in Section  4.
Survey of Income and Program  Participation,  2014–2017 .—Our exam-
ination  of the household  income  effect of the minimum  wage policy 
closely follows  Dube (2019 ). The original  study utilizes  the U.S. Current  
Population  Survey,  whereas  we use the Russian  Survey of Income  and 
Program  Participation  (SIPP), a comparable  dataset  to the one used 
in Dube (2019 ). Conducted  annually  by the Russian  Statistics  Service,  
the SIPP collects  detailed  information  on household  income  sources,  
income  levels, and participation  in government  programs  across all 
Russian  regions.  The number  of surveyed  individuals  varies, covering  
45,000 families  in 2014 and up to 160,000  in 2017.
3. Empirical  strategy
We begin by examining  the response  of the overall and age-specific  
unemployment  rates to changes  in the minimum  wage. Additionally,  we 
include  informal  employment  as an outcome  variable,  given its role as 
a source of income  for individuals  unable to secure formal employment  
(Porta and Shleifer , 2008 ; Comola  and Mello , 2011 ). Furthermore,  we 
investigate  whether  the employment  impact of the minimum  wage pol-
icy varies with the industry-specific  elasticity  of substitution  between  
capital and labor. Finally,  we assess the implications  of the policy for 
household  income.
3.1. Region-level  analysis
Our baseline  model leverages  the region-year  panel dataset  de-
scribed  in the previous  section.  We estimate  the following  two-way  
fixed-effects  model: 
𝑦𝑖𝑡=𝛽log𝑀𝑊𝑖𝑡+𝑋′
𝑖𝑡𝜌+𝜗𝑖+𝜏𝑡+𝑢𝑖𝑡, (1)
where 𝑖 and 𝑡 index regions  and years, respectively.  The outcome  
variable,  𝑦𝑖𝑡, represents  one of the following:  (i) the annual average  
overall unemployment  rate, (ii) age-specific  unemployment  rate (with 
age groups 15–19, 20–29, and 30+), or (iii) the informality  rate, 
defined  as the proportion  of the labor force employed  informally.Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

The primary  regressor,  log𝑀𝑊𝑖𝑡, is the natural  logarithm  of the 
annual average  real minimum  wage. 𝑋′
𝑖𝑡 is a vector of control  variables,  
𝜗𝑖 is the region fixed effect, 𝜏𝑡 is the year fixed effect, and 𝑢𝑖𝑡 is the 
error term. Consistent  with prior literature,  our baseline  specification  
includes  control  variables  such as the regional  Consumer  Price Index 
(CPI), the natural  logarithm  of regional  GDP per capita, and the natural  
logarithm  of the working-age  population  (Burkhauser  et al., 2000 ; Dube 
et al., 2010 ; Meer and West , 2016 ).
A potential  concern  with the OLS estimation  of Eq.  (1) is reverse  
causality.  It is unlikely  that regional  legislators  would raise the local 
minimum  wage if the local unemployment  rate is already  high. To 
address  this concern,  we employ  an instrumental  variable  for our key 
regressor,  log𝑀𝑊𝑖𝑡. Our primary  instrument  is the regional  average  
Winter Severity  Index for the three months  preceding  each March of 
a given year. For instance,  in the case of a given region observed  in the 
year 2009, we assign the value of the Winter Severity  Index averaged  
over December  2008, January  2009, and February  2009.
One of the earliest  measurements  of winter severity  was developed  
by the Swedish  scientist  Gösta Bodman.  In his summary  of the research  
expedition  to the South Pole (1901–1903),  Bodman  (1916 ) quantified  
the subjective  human perception  of winter severity  with the following  
equation,  now known as the Bodman  index: 
𝑆= (1 − 0.04 ×𝑇) × (1 + 0.27 ×𝑉), (2)
where 𝑆 denotes  the Bodman  index, 𝑇 represents  the temperature  
measured  on the Celsius scale (◦𝐶), and 𝑉 is the wind speed in meters 
per second (m/s). Higher values of 𝑆 indicate  a worse perception  of 
winter.  The larger coefficient  of 𝑉 (0.27) compared  to that of 𝑇 (0.04) 
aligns with Bodman’s  rationale,  which emphasizes  that wind speed 
carries greater  weight than temperature  in determining  the human 
perception  of coldness.  This is because  wind speed can lead to breathing  
difficulties,  skin damage,  and mechanical  pressure  on the human body. 
For instance,  if the temperature  is −25◦𝐶 and the wind speed is 1 m/s, 
the Bodman  index value is equal to 2.54. This value is nearly equivalent  
to a situation  where the temperature  is −5◦𝐶 and the wind speed is 
4.1 m/s.
The Bodman  index is a good candidate  for a valid instrumental  
variable  for the minimum  wage if it affects the level of minimum  wages 
(relevance)  while having no direct impact on the regional  unemploy-
ment rates (exclusion  restriction).  Thus, we first discuss the first-stage  
relationship  between  the regional  Bodman  index and the minimum  
wage level. We then present  our arguments  justifying  our exclusion  
restriction  assumption.
Fig.  1 shows that the minimum  wage consistently  exceeds  the 
federal floor in certain regions.  As elaborated  in Section  2.1, this 
phenomenon  finds its explanation  in the presence  of the Northern  
Multiplier.  In the North and Far East regions,  characterized  by cold 
winters,  workers  receive  higher minimum  wages irrespective  of labor 
market conditions.  Consequently,  the Northern  Multiplier  functions  as 
a region-specific  constant  wage multiplier,  which is fully absorbed  by 
region fixed effects. However,  the historical  existence  of this multiplier  
provides  a rationale  for the first-stage  causal relationship  between  
the Bodman  index and regional  minimum  wages. A worsening  per-
ception  of winter severity  equips local labor unions with bargaining  
power to advocate  for higher minimum  wages as compensation  for 
more challenging  working  conditions.  Indeed,  as detailed  in the results 
section,  consistent  with our conjecture,  our data reveal a strong and 
positive  first-stage  relationship  between  the Bodman  index and regional  
minimum  wages.
We now argue that the Bodman  index is unlikely  to have a direct 
impact on local unemployment  rates. Fig.  2 displays  the distribution  
of the OLS residuals  of the Bodman  index in 2012, the most recent 
cross-section  in our dataset.  These residuals  are obtained  after re-
gressing  the Bodman  index on region and year fixed effects using all 
regions  observed  from 2009 to 2012. The resulting  map suggests  that, 
once we account  for regional  time-invariant  characteristics  (such as geographic  location  and proximity  to water bodies)  and common  year-
specific  shocks,  the remaining  variation  in the index appears  to be 
nearly random.  Although  higher net levels of the Bodman  index are 
primarily  concentrated  in the northern  part of Russia, changes  within 
regions  do not seem to depend  on the region’s  geographic  location.  
Additionally,  we examine  a list of potential  factors that might mediate  
the observed  relationship  between  our IV and the unemployment  rate: 
regional  health indicators  (measured  as the population-to-doctor  ratio 
and the number  of registered  diseases  per 1,000 people),  net migration  
inflow per 10,000 people,  average  household  utility expenses,  labor 
force participation  rate, agricultural  productivity  index (measured  as 
agricultural  output over GDP), and electricity  production  (measured  in 
billions  of kWh). We document  that none of the indicators  mentioned  
above is correlated  with the Bodman  index, lending  further support  to 
our exclusion  restriction  assumption.
To formally  test the exclusion  restriction,  we introduce  an addi-
tional IV borrowed  from the existing  literature:  the mean of mini-
mum wages in geographically  adjacent  regions  (Neumark  and Wascher , 
1992 ; Rybczynski  and Sen, 2018 ). The underlying  rationale  is that 
local legislators  are likely influenced  by minimum  wage policies  in 
neighboring  regions.  While passing  the overidentification  test does not 
prove that the Bodman  index is excluded  from Eq.  (1), we interpret  the 
absence  of a statistically  significant  correlation  between  the IVs and the 
error term—as  is the case with our findings—as  additional  evidence  
supporting  the validity  of the exclusion  restriction  assumption.
3.2. A natural experiment  in the Kamchatka  region
Our analysis  of the regional  panel data heavily  relies on assumptions  
regarding  the validity  of our IV, and we provide  a range of diagnostic  
tests to assess their plausibility.  To further corroborate  our baseline  
findings,  we follow a well-established  tradition  of investigating  the 
employment  effects of minimum  wages in quasi-experimental  settings.
An ideal natural  experiment  would supply a pair of regions  that 
would have had parallel  employment  trends had one of them not 
introduced  a higher minimum  wage. With this in mind, we pick our 
‘‘treated’’  and ‘‘control’’  regions  that satisfy the following  criteria:
1.The minimum  wage increase  must be sizable so that possible  em-
ployment  effects are more likely to be detectable.  This criterion  
excludes  those cases in which regions  simply adjust local wage 
floors to inflation.
2.The intervention  must occur outside  of the first calendar  quarter.  
This condition  decreases  the likelihood  of policy anticipation  on 
the employers’  side, as in most cases, new minimum  wages are 
introduced  in the first quarter  of the year.
3.The initial minimum  wage in the ‘‘treated’’  region should follow 
the federal minimum,  as regions  with a long tradition  of higher 
minimum  wages are less likely to have labor market outcomes  
comparable  to those that follow the state’s wage floor.
In June 2012, the local minimum  wage rose from 4,611 RUB 
(Federal  Minimum  Wage) to 7,500 RUB in the Kamchatka  region. 
As shown in Fig.  1, the timing and magnitude  of this increase  are 
highly unusual.  First, most other regions  typically  update their local 
minimum  wages during the first calendar  quarter.  Second,  prior to June 
2012, Kamchatka  had consistently  aligned  its minimum  wage with the 
federal floor. The steep mid-year  deviation  from the federal minimum,  
as depicted  in Fig.  1, is nearly unprecedented.  These factors make it 
plausible  that Kamchatkan  employers  did not anticipate  this policy 
change.  Chukotka,  which is the only neighboring  region of Kamchatka,  
supplies  a natural  comparison  unit, as it is geographically  adjacent  Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

and strictly follows  the state’s wage floor throughout  the entire study 
period.6
It is natural  to wonder  about the possible  forces driving  the unusual  
minimum  wage increase  in Kamchatka.  Based on official statistics  
underlying  our data, it is unlikely  that this new wage floor was driven 
by favorable  macroeconomic  conditions.  The increase  occurred  in June 
2012. However,  in 2011, Kamchatka  ranked 63rd out of 83 regions  in 
terms of real GDP growth.  In the same year, the region ranked 58th 
for unemployment  and 49th for the consumer  price index. Thus, the 
large minimum  wage increase  was not preceded  by booming  economic  
growth,  exceptionally  low unemployment,  or a rapid rise in prices. 
Moreover,  regions  typically  update the local minimum  wage in the first 
quarter  of the year to account  for local macroeconomic  factors,  such as 
rising consumer  prices. This was not the case for Kamchatka  in 2012, 
where the new wage floor occurred  in June.
One probable  force behind the minimum  wage increase  might be 
the unexpected  appointment  of a new governor  in Kamchatka  in Febru-
ary 2011, Vladimir  Ilyukhin.  His appointment  followed  the voluntary  
resignation  of the former governor,  Alexey Kuzmitsky,  who had gov-
erned the region from July 2007 until February  2011, nearly a year 
less than the typical five-year  term. We were unable to retrieve  the 
official reason for the former governor’s  resignation  from the Kremlin’s  
website  archives.  However,  the most important  concern  is whether  
the appointment  of the new regional  administration  in early 2011 
led to employers  adjusting  their workforce  in anticipation  of the new 
minimum  wage policy—or  some other policy affecting  the local labor 
market.  Fortunately,  this can be tested with our data: as we show in the 
results section,  neither  unemployment  nor informality  rates responded  
to the ‘‘placebo’’  minimum  wage assigned  to 2011, the year of the new 
governor’s  appointment.  This finding  lends support  to the possibility  
that there was no precautionary  workforce  adjustment.
We utilize a subsample  of workers  from the two regions  mentioned  
above that is available  in RLFS 2010–2013.  Considering  the past ob-
servations  that the unemployment  response  to minimum  wages varies 
by workforce  age group, we divide our sample into the following  two 
6It is worth noting that in September  of the same year, Kamchatka  raised 
its minimum  wage by 40%. In an auxiliary  investigation,  we tested whether  
this second minimum  wage hike brought  different  employment  effects but 
failed to find such evidence.  These findings  suggest that it is the first—the  
June 2012—minimum  wage increase  that brought  employment  effects. These 
auxiliary  results are available  upon request from the authors.groups of workers:  young (𝑌) and older (𝑂). We use 30 as the threshold  
age—i.e.,  workers  younger  than 30 are categorized  as young, whereas  
older workers  are viewed  as the older workforce.  We consider  the 
following  econometric  models  for the two age groups:  
𝑦𝑌=𝛽𝑌
1𝑇+𝛽𝑌
2𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +𝛽𝑌
3𝑇×𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +𝑣𝑌, (3)
𝑦𝑂=𝛽𝑂
1𝑇+𝛽𝑂
2𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +𝛽𝑂
3𝑇×𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +𝑣𝑂, (4)
where 𝑦 is one of two binary outcomes:  (i) unemployment,  which is 
equal to one if the individual  is unemployed  (0 for the employed),  and 
(ii) informal  employment,  which is equal to one if the individual  is 
employed  informally  (0 for the formally  employed).  𝑇 is an indicator  
of the treated  region (Kamchatka),  and 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 is a dummy  indicating  the 
post-treatment  period (June 2012 and onward).  Equations  (3) and (4) 
are canonical  difference-in-differences  specifications.  If the OLS esti-
mate of 𝛽𝑌
3 and 𝛽𝑂
3 capture  the policy impact,  then the existence  of the 
difference  in unemployment  responses  to minimum  wages across the 
two age groups implies  the rejection  of the following  null hypothesis:  
𝐻0=𝛽𝑌
3−𝛽𝑂
3= 0 (5)
We test the above hypothesis  by combining  Equations  (3) and (4) 
as follows:  
𝑦=𝛿1𝑇+𝛿2𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +𝛿3𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔 +𝛿4𝑇×𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +𝛿5𝑇×𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔 +
𝛿6𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔 ×𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 +𝛿7𝑇×𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 ×𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔 +𝑣,(6)
where the new binary variable  𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔 takes on the value of 1 if the 
individual’s  age belongs  to the closed interval  [15, 29], and it is equal to 
0 otherwise.  The parameter  of interest  in Eq.  (6) is 𝛿7, which is known 
as the difference-in-difference-in-differences  estimator.  Testing  that 𝛿7
in Eq.  (6) is equal to zero is algebraically  identical  to testing the null 
hypothesis  given by Eq.  (5). Under the assumption  that both regions  
would have followed  parallel  unemployment  trends in the absence  of 
the new minimum  wage’s introduction,  𝛿7 from Eq.  (6) identifies  the 
policy impact on the workforce  aged below 30.
We also consider  a variant  of Eq.  (6) with a rich set of individual  
controls  (age, age squared,  marital  status dummy,  gender,  educational  
attainment,  urban area dummy,  number  of children  under 18 years 
in the household),  region-quarter  fixed effects, and the region-specific  
quartic  month-year  trend. Later in the text, we show that the estimated  
impact is not sensitive  to the inclusion  of the proposed  set of controls.Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

3.3. Industry-specific  employment  responses  to the minimum  wage policy
Given that the variation  of estimated  employment  effects of the min-
imum wage in the literature,  it is natural  to consider  the characteristics  
of a given labor market that policymakers  should pay close attention  
to when introducing  a new wage floor. In this paper, we argue that 
the substitutability  of capital for labor — which likely varies across 
countries  and within a given country  across industries  — is one labor-
market characteristic  that helps predict whether  raising the minimum  
wage will result in layoffs.  This insight comes from the theoretical  
works by Allen (1938 ) and Hamermesh  (1993 ), which show that la-
bor demand’s  wage elasticity  depends  upon the substitution  elasticity  
between  capital and labor. More specifically,  assuming  that (i) a given 
industry  employs  capital (𝐾) and labor (𝐿) to produce  output (𝑌); (ii) 
the inputs are transformed  into the output by a constant  elasticity  of 
substitution  production  function;  and (iii) in equilibrium,  the market 
for the final good clears, Allen (1938 ) shows that the wage elasticity  of 
labor demand  (𝜖𝐿
𝑤) can be expressed  as follows:  
𝜖𝐿
𝑤=𝑤𝐿
𝑌𝑝𝜖𝑌
𝑝−𝑟𝐾
𝑌𝑝𝜎, (7)
where 𝑤 and 𝑟 denote the price of labor and capital,  respectively;  𝑝 is 
the market price of the good 𝑌; 𝜖𝑌
𝑝 is the price elasticity  of demand;  
and 𝜎 is the elasticity  of substitution  between  capital and labor.
As can be seen from Eq.  (7), the magnitude  of employment  loss 
triggered  by raising wages depends  upon two parameters.  First, a 
higher price elasticity  of demand  for the final good (𝜖𝑌
𝑝) results in a 
larger loss of workers.  Second,  the substitutability  between  capital and 
labor — characterized  by the value of 𝜎 — matters.  As the elasticity  
of substitution  converges  to zero (𝜎→0), the production  function  ap-
proaches  the case of perfect complements,  in which the cost-minimizing  
demand  for labor and capital is invariant  to their relative  prices. In the 
opposite  case (i.e., 𝜎→∞), the production  function  converges  to the 
case of perfect substitutes,  in which demand  for labor and capital is 
very sensitive  to their relative  prices.
Inspired  by this insight from Allen (1938 ), we show empirically  
that employment  losses induced  by higher minimum  wages are indeed 
concentrated  in industries  capable  of substituting  capital.  To do so, we 
first estimate  the industry-specific  employment  response  to minimum  
wage increases  by fitting the following  equation:  
log𝑌𝑗𝑖𝑡=𝛼log𝑀𝑊𝑖𝑡+𝐽∑
𝑗=1𝜆𝑗log𝑀𝑊𝑖𝑡×𝜓𝑗+𝑋′
𝑖𝑡𝜂+𝜅𝑗×𝑖+𝜃𝑡+𝑢𝑗𝑖𝑡,(8)
where 𝑗, 𝑖, and 𝑡 index industry,  region, and year, respectively.7 The 
outcome  variables  (log𝑌𝑗𝑖𝑡) are the following:  (i) the natural  log of 
the number  of workers  aged below 30; and (ii) the natural  log of 
the number  of workers  employed  informally.  When constructing  the 
employment  outcome  variables,  we proceed  as follows.  First, we obtain 
the total labor force size from the Russian  Federal  State Statistics  
Service.  Next, using the labor force survey described  in Section  2.2, 
we calculate  the share of the labor force aged below 30 and the share 
of informally  employed  workers  in each industry ×region ×year cell. 
Finally,  with the two pieces of information  in hand, we estimate  the 
total number  of workers  aged below 30 and those employed  informally.
The main regressors  are the natural  log of the regional  minimum  
wage log𝑀𝑊𝑖𝑡 and its interaction  with the indicator  of industry  𝑗
(log𝑀𝑊𝑖𝑡×𝜓𝑗); the term 𝑋′
𝑖𝑡 is a vector of region-level  control  variables  
7In our analysis,  we consider  the following  industries:  (i) Agriculture,  
Forestry,  and Fishing;  (ii) Mining; (iii) Building  and Construction;  (iv) Man-
ufacturing;  (v) Transportation  and Communication;  (vi) Electricity,  Gas, and 
Water; (vii) Wholesale  and Retail; (viii) Finance and Insurance;  (ix) Real

instruments  for the minimum  wage variable  and its interaction  with 
𝜓𝑗, respectively.  Our focus is on the estimated  value of 𝛼+𝜆𝑗, which 
informs  about the elasticity  of youth/informal  employment  with respect  
to the regional  minimum  wage in a given industry.
Next, we estimate  the industry-specific  substitutability  between  cap-
ital and labor in the following  two ways. The first approach  is to use log 
capital investments  as the outcome  in Eq.  (8); in this case, the estimated  
𝛼+𝜆𝑗 informs  about a given industry’s  ability to substitute  capital for 
labor. For example,  a negative  value 𝛼+𝜆𝑗 would imply that employers  
in the industry  in question  reduce capital investments  in response  to the 
minimum  wage increase,  which likely indicates  the complementarity  
between  capital and labor. On the other hand, a positive  value would 
indicate  that capital and labor can substitute  for each other in a given 
industry.
Another  approach  we adopt is to follow Arrow et al. (1961 ), who 
use the joint variation  of the value-added  per worker  and the real wages 
to identify  the substitution  elasticity  in each industry.  Specifically,  we 
fit the following  model: 
log𝑉𝑗
𝑖𝑡=𝜎𝑗log𝑊𝐴𝐺𝐸𝑗
𝑖𝑡+𝑋′
𝑖𝑡𝜌+𝜁𝑡+𝑡𝑐𝑖+𝜔𝑗
𝑖𝑡(9)
The outcome  variable,  log𝑉𝑗
𝑖𝑡, is the natural  log of value added per 
worker  in industry  𝑗, region 𝑖, and year 𝑡.
After obtaining  a set of estimates  for industry-specific  (i) employ-
ment responses  from Eq.  (8) and (ii) elasticities  of substitution  from Eq. 
(9), we assess whether  the two sets of point estimates  are negatively  
correlated.

Table  2 presents  the instrumental  variable  estimates  of Eq.  (1). 
Panel A displays  the second-stage  results,  while Panel B shows the 
first-stage  regression  of the log real minimum  wage on the excluded  
instrument,  the Bodman  index, and covariates.  We begin by discussing  
the results in Panel A.
Column  (1) of Panel A confirms  the findings  of recent literature,  
indicating  that the estimated  minimum  wage coefficient  is statistically  
insignificant  and numerically  close to zero in the overall unemployment  
regression.  Columns  (2) and (3) suggest  that the young workforce  is

particularly  vulnerable,  as a one percent  increase  in the real minimum  
wage results in a 0.04 and 0.053 percentage  point increase  in the 
unemployment  rates among those aged 15–19 and 20–29, respectively.  
Column  (4) implies  that the older workforce  — those aged 30 years 
and above — is unlikely  to be affected  by the minimum  wage policy. 
Column  (5) shows an increase  in the informality  rate in response  to the 
minimum  wage hike, suggesting  that the minimum  wage policy binds 
employers.  Faced with higher labor costs, companies  may hire workers  
off-the-books  to replace  formal workers.
As discussed  in the methodology  section,  we can identify  the impact 
of interest  if the Bodman  index affects the regional  minimum  wage 
while being excluded  from the unemployment  equation.  As Panel B 
shows, the Bodman  index positively  affects the regional  minimum  
wage, and the impact is precisely  estimated.  Therefore,  we must justify 
the assumption  that the minimum  wage is the only channel  through  
which our proposed  instrument  affects unemployment.
Our first strategy  is to check whether  our instrument  affects unem-
ployment  through  other channels,  such as health, migration,  agricul-
tural productivity,  energy costs, and labor force participation.  While 
this list is largely speculative,  we believe  it includes  the most plausible  
pathways  through  which the Bodman  index may affect regional  unem-
ployment.  For example,  one might argue that a worse perception  of 
winter severity  correlates  with workers’  health, influencing  their deci-
sion to participate  in the labor force. There is also the possibility  that 
workers  prefer locations  with milder winter conditions.  Additionally,  
fluctuations  in the Bodman  index may affect agricultural  output and 
electricity  costs. Finally,  economic  activity  could be related to winter 
severity  for reasons  unrelated  to workers’  health, such as productivity  
losses or caregiving  for sick dependents  (Han et al., 2023 ).
We therefore  consider  the following  regional  characteristics:  (i) 
log population-to-doctors  ratio, (ii) log number  of registered  diseases  
per 1,000 people,  (iii) net migration  inflow (per 10,000 people),  (iv) 
agricultural  output normalized  by regional  GDP, (v) log of electricity  
production  (billions  of kWh), (vi) average  household  utility expenses  
normalized  by average  household  income,  and (vii) labor force partici-
pation rate. We check whether  these regional  characteristics  respond  to 
changes  in the Bodman  index. Table B1 in Online Appendix  B presents  
the results,  showing  that none of the variables  respond  to changes  in 
the Bodman  index. This exercise  largely excludes  the possibility  that the 
Bodman  index affects the regional  unemployment  rate through  health, 
migration,  agricultural  productivity,  electricity  costs, or the regional  
labor force participation  rate. This strengthens  the assumption  that 
the regional  minimum  wage is the only channel  through  which our 
instrument  affects the local unemployment  rate.
Our second approach  to assessing  the validity  of our instrument  
is a direct statistical  test of the exclusion  restriction,  which requires  
at least two instruments  for the minimum  wage variable.  We use an 
additional  instrumental  variable,  the mean of the minimum  wages in 
geographically  bordering  regions.  Table  3 presents  the results.  Panel 
A shows that the inclusion  of the additional  instrument  does not 
significantly  alter the baseline  point estimates.  Panel B displays  the 
first-stage  regression  result. The coefficient  of the additional  instru-
ment, 𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑎𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑔𝑒 𝑀𝑊 𝑎𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑔 𝑛𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑠 ), is positive  and statistically  
significant,  confirming  the spillover  effect from neighboring  regions.  
Moreover,  the 𝐹 statistic  of the excluded  instruments  supports  the 
strength  of the first-stage  relationship.  The last row of Table  3 reports 
the 𝑝-values of the Sargan-Hansen  𝐽 test. None of the 𝑝-values fall 
below the 10% significance  level, further supporting  our belief that the 
Bodman  index is excluded  from Eq.  (1).
4.2. Unemployment  response  in Kamchatka
In this subsection,  we present  the findings  from the natural  experi-
ment in the Kamchatka  region. Table  4 provides  summary  statistics  for 
all variables  used in the analysis,  while Table  5 presents  the regression  
results both with and without  controls.  Columns  (1)–(3)  report the results for unemployment,  and columns  (4)–(6)  report the results for 
informal  employment.
Notably,  the point estimate  of the triple interaction  term (𝑇×
𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 ×𝑌𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑔 ) remains  robust to the inclusion  of controls.  For instance,  
columns  (1)–(3)  suggest  that the minimum  wage hike increased  the 
probability  of unemployment  by approximately  3 percentage  points 
for individuals  under the age of 30. Columns  (4)–(6)  show that the 
probability  of informal  employment  among young workers  increased  
by 4 percentage  points following  the minimum  wage increase.
In summary,  the results in Table  5 indicate  that the introduction  
of the minimum  wage policy is associated  with a 0.03 (0.05) increase  
in the probability  of being unemployed  (employed  informally)  among 
young workers.  The coefficients  of the 𝑇×𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 term in columns  
(1)–(3)  suggest  that the minimum  wage policy is unlikely  to affect 
unemployment  among older workers,  consistent  with prior research  
and our previous  findings  in this section.  However,  columns  (4)–(6)  
suggest  that informality  responds  positively  to the minimum  wage even 
among more experienced  employees.
The validity  of the results reported  in Table  5 relies on the as-
sumption  that employment  trends in both regions  would have followed  
parallel  paths in the absence  of the policy intervention.  To test this 
assumption,  we exploit the fact that both regions  adhered  to the state’s 
minimum  wage floor in 2010 and 2011. We define a placebo  post-
treatment  variable,  which is set to 1 for the year 2011 and 0 for 
2010. We then substitute  the term 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 with this placebo  treatment  
in Eq.  (6) and estimate  the resulting  model, with the results reported  
in Table  6. The findings  suggest  that the two regions  do not exhibit 
statistically  significant  differences  in unemployment  trends during the 
pre-treatment  period.  This result further supports  the validity  of the 
proposed  quasi-experimental  design.
Our findings  from the Kamchatka  region are largely consistent  with 
the benchmark  result presented  in Section  4.1. The regional  panel data 
estimate  suggests  that a one-percentage-point  increase  in the minimum  
wage raises the local unemployment  rate among workers  aged below 30 
by 0.05 percentage  points. The Kamchatka  case study indicates  that a 
63% increase  in Kamchatka’s  minimum  wage led to a three-percentage-
point higher probability  of unemployment  among workers  aged below 
30. In other words, a one-percent  increase  in Kamchatka’s  minimum  
wage raised the share of unemployed  youth by 0.05 percentage  points, 
which is consistent  with the baseline  estimate  from the regional  panel 
data.
4.3. Industry-specific  employment  response  to the minimum  wage policy
Columns  (1) and (2) of Table  7 present  estimates  of industry-
specific  responses  of the number  of young workers  and the number  of 
workers  employed  informally,  respectively,  to changes  in the minimum  
wage. The results indicate  that, in most industries,  an increase  in the 
minimum  wage leads to a reduction  in the number  of workers  aged 
below 30 and an increase  in informal  employment,  with the exceptions  
of Education  and Health.  The substitutability  between  formally  and 
informally  employed  workers  becomes  more apparent  when we plot 
the coefficients  from column  (1) of Table  7 against  those from column  
(2) in Fig.  3. Industries  that displace  fewer young workers  in response  
to the minimum  wage tend to hire more workers  informally.
Column  (3) of Table  7 presents  the estimated  response  of capital 
investments  to changes  in the minimum  wage, while Column  (4) reports 
the estimated  elasticity  of substitution  between  capital and labor for 
each sector. Due to the lack of wage data for the financial  sector, 
the corresponding  cell is left empty. We then link the industry-specific  
employment  responses  to minimum  wages (as reported  in column  1 of 
Table  7) to the results in columns  3 and 4, and illustrate  them in the 
two panels of Fig.  4.
Panel (a) of Fig.  4 plots the point estimates  from column  (1) against  
those from column  (4) of Table  7. The resulting  downward-sloping  
line illustrates  the estimated  cross-industry  average  employment  loss Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

moderated  by the elasticity  of substitution  between  capital and labor. 
As shown in the figure, a higher elasticity  of substitution  is associated  
with a larger (in magnitude)  employment  loss in a given industry,  
consistent  with theoretical  predictions.  Panel (b) of Fig.  4 plots the 
point estimates  from column  (1) against  those from column  (3) of 
Table  7. The pattern  is as follows:  industries  that are more capable  
of increasing  capital investments  in response  to the minimum  wage 
increase  tend to reduce their demand  for young workers,  consistent  
with the capital-labor  substitution  hypothesis  discussed  in Section  3.3.
The patterns  in Figs.  5and6 suggest  that industries  have at least 
two ways to adapt to the minimum  wage shock. First, if the produc-
tion technology  allows for substituting  capital for labor, the industry  
responds  accordingly.  This finding  aligns with the literature  on capital

investment  responses  to minimum  wage increases  (Hau et al., 2020 ; 
Baek et al., 2021 ). Second,  our results indicate  that informal  recruit-
ment is another  means of adjusting  to higher labor costs: Employers  
are more likely to hire workers  informally  when facing an increased  
minimum  wage.
These results raise questions  about the effectiveness  of the Russian  
minimum  wage policy as a tool for alleviating  poverty.  Job losses 
among young workers  and the informalization  of the labor market due 
to minimum  wage increases  may limit the policy’s  ability to effectively  
assist the poor.
4.4. Who are informally  employed?
A substantial  portion  of our analysis  is dedicated  to investigating  
the implications  of the Russian  minimum  wage policy for informal  
employment.  The key feature of informal  employment  relevant  to our 
analysis  is its invisibility  to legislators,  meaning  the minimum  wage 
does not bind for such workers.  In this section,  we provide  descriptive  
characteristics  of informally  employed  workers  using the SIPP data 
described  in Section  2.9 We first examine  the proportion  of individuals  
9Although  the Labor Force Survey might seem to be a natural candidate  
for such an investigation,  it does not contain information  on earnings,  which 
is why we chose the SIPP data for this part of the analysis.Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

and incomplete  secondary.  The omitted  group comprises  individuals

The estimates  of 𝛼𝑎 (𝜂𝑒) capture  the change  in the proportion  of 
individuals  employed  informally  relative  to the omitted  group, which 
comprises  individuals  aged 15 to 19 years (without  any secondary

obtained  without  any controls,  and (ii) those obtained  after including  
the full set of controls.
Fig.  5 presents  the results by age group. We observe  that, relative  to 
individuals  aged 15 to 19 years, each older age group has a lower pro-
portion  of informally  employed  individuals.  This result holds regardless  
of the deployment  of controls.  Moreover,  an overall negative  trend is 
evident  as we move to older worker  groups,  indicating  that, conditional  
on having a job, the likelihood  of being employed  informally  decreases  
with age.
Fig.  6 displays  the proportion  of employed  individuals  with informal  
jobs by education  group. It is clear that higher educational  attainment  
is negatively  associated  with the likelihood  of having an informal  job 
(as opposed  to formal employment).  The point estimates  show little 
difference  between  the unadjusted  and fully saturated  models.
In summary,  informally  employed  workers  are, on average,  (i) 
younger  and (ii) less educated  compared  to their formally  employed  Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

counterparts.  We now proceed  with a descriptive  examination  of the 
implications  of informal  employment  for annual earnings  by fitting the 
following  model: 
𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝐴𝑛𝑛𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑛𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠𝑖𝑟𝑡) =𝜏𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑟𝑡+𝑋′
𝑖𝑟𝑡𝜙+𝜗𝑟×𝑡+𝑣𝑖𝑟𝑡. (11)
The outcome  variable  is the natural  log of annual earned income  
for individual  𝑖 observed  in region 𝑟 in year 𝑡. The main regressor  is 
an indicator  of informal  employment,  𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑟𝑡 (1 for informal,  0 for 
formal).  We control  for a vector of covariates,  𝑋′
𝑖𝑟𝑡, which comprises  
fixed effects for each age and education  group as in Eq.  (11), as well 
as marital  status, an urban-area  dummy,  gender,  and an indicator  for 
having at least one child under 18. We also control  for region-year  
fixed effects, 𝜃𝑟×𝑡, thereby  absorbing  region-level  shocks and deflating  
for the annual income  variable.  𝑣𝑖𝑟𝑡 is the error term clustered  at the 
region level. We use sampling  weights  when running  the regression.  
The estimate  of 𝜏 represents  the difference  in real annual earned income  
between  informally  and formally  employed  workers.
Table  8 reports the results.  Column  (1) shows the simple regression  
result, while column  (2) presents  the estimate  obtained  after including  
the full set of controls.  Results  in both columns  suggest  that having an 
informal  job (versus  formal employment)  is associated  with a reduction  
in annual earned income  of approximately  28.6% (= [𝑒−0.337− 1] × 100 ) 
to 43.3% (= [𝑒−0.568− 1] × 100 ).
Taken together,  the results from this subsection  paint the following  
picture:  compared  to formally  employed  workers,  those with informal  
jobs are younger,  less educated,  and earn lower income.  These findings  
suggest  that informal  employment  represents  a form of precarious  
work, providing  a buffer against  full unemployment  for individuals  
with sufficiently  low reservation  wages, provided  that local labor de-
mand supports  it. Therefore,  it is perhaps  unsurprising  that the increase  
in unemployment  due to the minimum  wage observed  in our earlier 
analysis  is accompanied  by a rise in informal  employment.Table 8

5. Does the Russian  minimum  wage policy help the poor?
The minimum-wage  policy is designed  to assist individuals  at the 
lower end of the income  distribution.  However,  according  to our find-
ings, in Russia, this policy leads to job losses among workers  under 
30 years of age and an increase  in the proportion  of workers  employed  
informally.  Given these findings,  it is natural  to question  whether  the 
policy meaningfully  aids the poorest.
To examine  the implications  of the minimum  wage policy for family 
income,  we adopt an approach  deployed  in Dube (2019 ). Specifically,  
Dube estimates  the household  income  effects of the policy by fitting the 
following  specification:  
𝐼𝑐𝑖𝑟𝑡=3∑
𝑘=−1𝛼𝑐𝑘log(𝑀𝑊𝑟(𝑡−𝑘)) +𝑋𝑖𝑟𝑡𝛹𝑐+𝛩+𝛾𝑟𝑡+𝜖𝑐𝑖𝑟𝑡 (12)
The outcome  variable  is an indicator  of the 𝑖th individual  observed  
in region 𝑟 at time 𝑡 in a family whose value of equalized  income  
divided  by the federal poverty  threshold  falls below 𝑐. For example,  the 
observation  with 𝐼1𝑖𝑟𝑡= 1 indicates  that the individual’s  family is below 
the official poverty  threshold.  Similarly,  𝐼0.5𝑖𝑟𝑡= 1 indicates  that the 
equalized  income  of the 𝑖th individual’s  household  is below 0.5 times Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

the official poverty  rate. Following  the baseline  analysis  in Dube’s work, 
we consider  the values of 𝑐 between  0.5 and 1.75 in increments  of 0.25.
In Dube (2019 ), the set of key variables  of interest  includes  con-
temporaneous,  one-year  leading,  and three-year  lagged values of the 
real minimum  wage. The model also incorporates  individual-level  char-
acteristics  (quartic  age, gender,  race, education,  family size, number  
of children,  and marital  status) and state-level  macroeconomic  indi-
cators (unemployment  rate, income  per capita, and EITC supplement)  
on its right-hand  side. The term 𝛩 includes  the region fixed effect, 
division-year  fixed effect, and the region fixed effect interacted  with 
the indicators  of recessionary  years (2007–2009);  𝛾𝑠𝑡 represents  the 
region-specific  linear trend, and 𝜖𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑡 denotes  the error term.
Our replication  exercise  deviates  from the original  estimation  strat-
egy of Dube (2019 ) in three ways. First, Russia does not have an 
equivalent  of the EITC program.  Second,  microdata  on households  are unavailable  for the recessionary  years. Finally,  our dataset  lacks 
information  on the ethnicity  of respondents.  Besides  the exclusion  of 
the above information  from the set of control  variables,  our set of 
controls  is analogous  to that employed  in Dube (2019 ). Additionally,  
we narrow  the focus of our analysis  to the working-age  population,  
resulting  in a final sample of 373,555  individuals.
Using the set of estimated  coefficients  of the minimum  wage vari-
ables from Eq.  (12), we calculate  the long-run  elasticity  of the pro-
portion  of individuals  falling below the income-to-needs  cutoff, 𝑐, with 
respect  to the minimum  wage by estimating  the following  expression:
𝐸𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 =∑3
𝑘=0𝛼𝑐𝑘
𝜇𝑐,
where 𝜇𝑐 is the share of the population  below 𝑐, which we can estimate  
using our data.Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

cutoffs.  Column  (1) shows multiples  of the federal poverty  threshold.  
Column  (2) reports baseline  results retrieved  from the original  U.S. 
study by Dube (2019 ).11 Column  (3) presents  the results obtained  using 
our data. Contrasting  the results reported  in columns  (2)–(3),  we ob-
serve that poverty  in Russia is less sensitive  to changes  in the minimum  
wage. For instance,  in the United States, the estimated  reduction  in 
the proportions  of individuals  falling below 50% and 100% of the 
federal poverty  threshold  in response  to a one-unit  change  in 𝐿𝑜𝑔(𝑀𝑊 )
is −0.455 and −0.446, respectively.  However,  in Russia, the estimated  
elasticities  are −0.048 and −0.070. The numerical  values of estimated  
elasticities  decrease  in both countries  as the income-to-needs  cutoff, 𝑐, 
increases.
The results in this section indicate  the relatively  limited  effec-
tiveness  of the Russian  minimum  wage as a poverty-alleviating  tool 
compared  to the same policy in the United States. Job losses among 
young workers  and the informalization  of the Russian  labor market,  
both induced  by minimum  wage increases,  are two natural  explanations  
for this finding.
6. Conclusion
This paper assesses  the employment  effects of the minimum  wage 
policy in Russia. We first investigate  whether  regional  unemployment  
rates respond  to the rising wage floor. Our results suggest  that overall 
unemployment  rates remain unchanged,  while young workers  (those 
aged under 30) are affected.  The point estimates  indicate  that a one-
percentage-point  increase  in the real minimum  wage raises unemploy-
ment rates among teenagers  (15–19  years old) and young workers  
(20–29  years old) by 0.046 and 0.056 percentage  points, respectively.  
We also provide  evidence  of a redistribution  of workers  toward  the in-
formal sector resulting  from the implementation  of a higher wage floor. 
Our estimates  are robust to alternative  model specifications.  We also 
show that our findings  hold when we employ  an alternative  empirical

Notes: This table reports the long-run (3 years) elasticities  of the share with family 
income under various multiples  of the federal poverty threshold  with respect to the 
minimum  wage. The multiples  of the federal poverty threshold  are listed in Column 
(1). Column (2) shows the U.S. estimates  obtained from Dube (2019 ), and Column (3) 
presents the authors’ estimates  obtained from a nearly analogous  empirical  exercise

design:  a one-percentage-point  increase  in the nominal  minimum  wage 
in Kamchatka  raised the share of unemployed  youth by 0.05 percentage  
points. This finding  also passes a set of robustness  checks.
Next, we investigate  whether  the estimated  employment  effects of 
the minimum  wage policy differ across industries.  We show that indus-
tries with a greater  capacity  to substitute  capital for labor are more 
likely to experience  steeper  losses in youth employment.  However,  
when substitution  is not feasible  due to the underlying  production  
technology,  industries  tend to employ  more workers  informally  when 
the minimum  wage increases.  Consequently,  we infer that differences  
in employers’  ability to substitute  labor with capital and formal workers  
with informal  ones — factors that vary across countries  and time peri-
ods — help explain  the variation  in estimated  unemployment  effects of 
minimum  wages across studies.
Lastly, we assess the effectiveness  of Russia’s  minimum  wage policy 
as a poverty  alleviation  tool. Consistent  with observed  job losses among 
youth and rising informal  employment,  we find its impact on work-
ers’ income  to be minimal.  These findings  cast doubt on the policy’s  
effectiveness  in supporting  low-income  families,  its primary  objective.
It is important  to acknowledge  some limitations  of our analysis  that 
may open avenues  for future research.  First, our study focuses  on a 
short time frame, covering  the years 2009–2013.  This period follows  
the global financial  crisis of 2008 and precedes  the economic  downturn  
triggered  by the annexation  of Crimea  in 2014. Future research  could 
examine  the implications  of the minimum  wage using data spanning  a 
longer period while isolating  the effects of a higher wage floor from 
broader  macroeconomic  shocks.  These shocks — driven by import 
restrictions  and domestic  monetary  policy — could also be leveraged  
to explore  possible  heterogeneity  in the minimum  wage effect under 
different  macroeconomic  conditions.
Next, a recent advancement  in the difference-in-differences  and two-
way fixed effects literature  has highlighted  the fragility  of estimated  
minimum  wage effects in the presence  of staggered  policy adoption  
and heterogeneity  in its effects (Dube and Lindner , 2024 ). Relatedly,  
Callaway  and Sant’Anna  (2021 ) discuss a family of estimators  de-
signed to address  these concerns.  The authors  also demonstrate  an 
application  of one of their proposed  methods  by aggregating  multi-
ple individual  cases of minimum  wage increases  into a generalized  
event-study  research  design using U.S. data. Specifically,  they select 
a time window,  2001–2007,  during which the federal minimum  wage 
remained  unchanged.  With this ‘‘clean’’  control  group in hand, they Economic  Modelling  148 (2025)  107086

estimate  employment  effects by leveraging  variation  in the minimum  
wage stemming  from states that adopted  higher wage floors at different  
points within this period.  Notably,  Cengiz et al. (2019 ) adopt a similar 
approach  to constructing  a ‘‘clean’’  control  group in their analysis.
These advancements  may prompt  efforts to construct  a ‘‘clean’’  
control  group in Russia, where the minimum  wage remains  unchanged  
for a sufficiently  long period.  The primary  challenge,  however,  is the 
high frequency  of minimum  wage adjustments  in Russia compared  
to the U.S. Specifically,  as Dube and Lindner  (2024 ) pointedly  note, 
local wage-floor  increases  in the U.S. between  1980 and 2019 largely 
occurred  in three waves: Once in the 1980s and twice in the 2000s. 
Combined  with long periods  of respite from federal minimum  wage 
increases,  this pattern  allows for various  comparisons  of employment  
trends between  treated  states and a ‘‘clean’’  control  group. Meanwhile,  
the Russian  government  strives to raise the federal wage floor on an 
annual basis, making  it particularly  challenging  to identify  a control  
group where the minimum  wage remains  unchanged  for a sufficiently  
long period.
At a broader  level, of course,  further research  is required  to obtain 
a bigger picture of the ramifications  of the minimum  wage increase  
on the economy,  as well as the role of firm-level  technology  and the 
prevalence  of informality  in the labor market.  For example,  a strand 
of literature  examines  the implications  of the minimum  wage for non-
labor outcomes,  such as food consumption  choices  (e.g., Clark et al., 
2020 ), health (e.g., Liu et al., 2024 ; Neumark , 2024 ), and the gender 
pay gap (e.g., Majchrowska  and Strawiński , 2018 ). Future research  may 
investigate  the potential  heterogeneity  of these effects depending  on the 
substitutability  of production  inputs and the extent of noncompliance  
with the policy in question.  Additionally,  there is a rich literature  
on skill-biased  technological  change  and its implications  for the wage 
distribution  (e.g., Card and DiNardo , 2002 ; Mallick  and Sousa , 2017 ), 
which opens the door to empirical  explorations  of the effects of skill-
biased technological  change  on the magnitude  of the minimum  wage 
elasticity  of labor demand.  The ongoing  discussion  of the evolution  of college wage premium  over time (e.g., Fortin , 2006 ; Boero et al., 2025 ) 
may also prompt  an investigation  into the role of the minimum  wage 
— and the forces moderating  its impact — in shaping  wage gaps among 
workers  with different  levels of education.  Lastly, a nascent  literature  
explores  the effect of raising the wage floor on the non-profit  sector 
(e.g., Balsam  et al., 2023 ; Meer and Tajali , 2023 ), making  it natural  to 
inquire  whether  the capital-labor  substitution  hypothesis  investigated  
in our paper can be tested in firms whose main objective  function  
differs from profit maximization.

All rights reserved.Minimum wage and internal income disparity within enterprises Hao Lia,*, Xiaoxue Jub aRural Development Institute, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing, 100732, China bPeoples’ Friendship University of Russia, Moscow, 117198, Russia   ARTICLE INFO  Keywords: Internal income disparity Minimum wage ABSTRACT  The internal income gap within enterprises refers to the differences in compensation among employees within the same company. This paper takes non-financial listed companies in China as the research subject and empirically tests the impact of the regional minimum wage standards on the internal income disparity within enterprises. The study results indicate that higher regional minimum wage standards are conducive to narrowing the internal income disparities within enterprises. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the restraining effect of minimum wage standards on internal income disparity is more pronounced in enterprises located in regions with lower levels of marketization and in small-scale enterprises.   1.Introduction The cost effect for enterprises is primarily manifested when changes in the minimum wage affect the costs required to employ labor. Implementing a minimum wage protection system has, to some extent, promoted the establishment of a harmonious society and created reasonable compensation standards for company development. However, since such standards are the basis for well- distributed internal allocation, companies can implement more in-depth reforms of the internal compensation structure according to these standards. In addition, the minimum wage standard has a cost effect; changes in the minimum wage standard can lead to an increase in the average wage of the enterprise and a decrease in the operating capacity of the enterprise (Draca et al., 2011). The internal pay gap within an enterprise is a key link in the design of the enterprise’s compensation system, involving the issue of compensation distribution, that is, the reasonable allocation between labor and management elements (Xu and Wang, 2023). Scientific and rational compensation management and designing a hierarchical compensation system are not only related to the economic benefits and innovative development of the enterprise but are more importantly related to the immediate interests of each worker and even the national income distribution pattern. Therefore, a deep understanding and increased awareness of the internal wage gap can help enterprises formulate more reasonable internal compensation distribution policies and make optimal compensation incentive decisions. Particularly, focusing on and resolving the issue of internal pay disparity helps establish a more equitable and sustainable compensation system, promotes employee motivation, and also has a positive impact on the overall income distribution in society (Han et al., 2021). The findings of this paper indicate that the minimum wage standard can narrow the internal income disparity within enterprises. Further heterogeneity analysis results show that the minimum wage standard plays a significant role in alleviating internal income disparity in enterprises in high-marketization areas and in smaller-scale enterprises.

2economic impacts. First, it sheds light on how these standards can reduce internal income disparities within enterprises. Our findings reveal a positive correlation between minimum wage policies and the narrowing of pay gaps within companies, offering new insights into the broader socio-economic implications of these policies. Second, the study delves into heterogeneity analysis and uncovers that the impact of minimum wage standards is more pronounced in regions with higher marketization and in smaller-scale enterprises. This discovery is pivotal for understanding the nuanced effects of minimum wage policies across different regional economies and corporate structures, highlighting the importance of considering these factors in policy design and implementation. Lastly, the research provides fresh empirical evidence on the relationship between minimum wage standards and internal income disparity within enterprises. By exploring this under-researched area, our study fills a critical gap in the literature and offers valuable empirical data to inform policymakers. These insights are particularly useful for fine-tuning minimum wage policies to ensure they effectively address wage disparities while considering the diverse economic landscapes in which businesses operate. 2.Literature review 2.1.Minimum wage There is currently no consensus on the impact of minimum wage policies on employment. Neumark and Wascher (1992) believe that the implementation of minimum wage policies leads to a displacement effect of labor, resulting in unemployment for some workers, especially affecting the low-skilled labor force more significantly. Leigh (2003), in his study of the impact of minimum wage changes on the employment of different genders and age groups of labor, selected young adult workers aged 15–24 as the subjects, using data from Australia. Through a natural experiment analysis, he concluded that both men and women are subject to greater negative employment impacts than other age groups of the labor force. Card and Krueger (1995) argue that an increase in the min-imum wage standard does not necessarily lead to a decrease in the employment rate and may even promote employment and reduce the poverty rate. 2.2.Internal income disparity As research related to internal pay disparities becomes more abundant and expansive, studies on the mechanisms behind the formation of internal pay disparities and their economic consequences have gradually increased. From the perspective of formation mechanisms, early international scholars obtained empirical evidence linking governance structure and internal pay disparity. For example, Bebchuk and Fried (2003) found that the larger the company’s board of directors and the more agents participating in promotion competitions, the greater the internal pay disparity. Some scholars have focused on the impact of executive power on internal pay disparity. The managerial power hypothesis explains that if a company has significant agency problems, managers can greatly influence the company’s decisions and have strong motives to use their accumulated power for rent-seeking, thereby increasing their own compensation (Cyert et al., 2002; Fahlenbrach, 2009). From the perspective of economic consequences, the study by Faleye et al. (2013) suggests that internal pay disparities can create positive incentives, stimulate employees’ enthusiasm for work, encourage them to increase job involvement, and have a significant positive impact on the business performance of the company. Conversely, Cowherd and Levine (1992) found that a large internal pay disparity can make employees feel exploited, which can lead to resistance and even actions that disrupt the company’s production and operations, such as strikes. Moreover, some scholars have discovered a nonlinear inverted U-shaped relationship between internal pay disparity and corporate innovation activities. Specifically, when the internal pay disparity is low, tournament theory predominates in explanatory power, while when the internal pay disparity is high, behavioral theory has stronger explanatory power. Although existing research has explored the formation mechanisms and economic consequences of internal income disparity from multiple aspects, current studies have overlooked the exploration of its impact from the perspective of minimum wage. 3.Data and variables 3.1.Data sources To avoid the impact of the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, the study uses companies listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share markets from 2011 to 2019 as the initial research samples. The samples were then screened as follows: (1) Exclude companies in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries; (2) Exclude companies that are designated as PT or ST, those that have been delisted, and those with missing data; (3) To reduce the impact of outliers, the main continuous variables are Winsorized at the top and bottom 1 %. Data on minimum wage standards come from the CNRDS database, while the remaining data are from the CSMAR database. 3.2.Variables 3.2.1.Minimum wage The core explanatory variable matches the minimum wage standard according to the prefecture-level city or district (district, county) where the enterprise is located. The core explanatory variable is represented by Mwagec.t, where the subscript c indicates the H. Li and X. Ju

3region, and t indicates the minimum wage standard for the region in that year. To minimize the impact of data dimensionality, it is expressed in natural logarithms. 3.2.2.Corporate internal income disparity In this paper, the internal pay gap (Gap) is defined as the ratio of the average compensation of management to the average compensation of employees. Specifically, management includes all executives, directors (except independent directors), and super-visors, while employees comprise all regular staff. The average compensation of management is calculated by dividing the "total annual salary of directors, supervisors, and executives" by the size of the management, where the size of the management is defined as the sum of the adjusted number of directors, supervisors, and executives. Since the compensation of independent directors is relatively constant, and some members of the management do not receive compensation, the number of independent directors and the members of the management who do not receive compensation are excluded when calculating the size of the management. The average compensation of employees is calculated by taking the change in "total employee compensation payable" plus "cash paid to and for employees" minus "total annual salary of directors, supervisors, and executives," and then dividing by the number of employees. 3.2.3.Control variables In this paper, company size (Size), debt-to-asset ratio (Lev), return on total assets (Roa), growth (Grow), ratio of fixed assets (Tan_rate), age of the listed company (Age), shareholding ratio of the largest shareholder (Sharel), and size of the board of directors (Board) are selected as control variables. Additionally, fixed effects for year and industry are controlled. Size is measured by the natural logarithm of total assets at the end of the year; Lev is measured by the ratio of total liabilities at the end of the year to total assets at the end of the year; Roa is measured by the ratio of net profit to total assets at the end of the year; Grow is measured by the ratio of the difference between the current year’s operating income and the previous year’s operating income to the operating income of the same period in the previous year; Tan_rate is measured by the ratio of fixed assets at the end of the year to total assets at the end of the year; Age is represented by the natural logarithm of the number of years the company has been listed; Sharel is measured by the ratio of the number of shares held by the largest shareholder to the total number of shares at the end of the year; Board is measured by the natural logarithm of the number of board members. 4.Empirical results 4.1.Description statistics Table 1 reports the descriptive statistical results of the main variables in this paper. The minimum wage measurement indicator (Mwage) has a minimum value of 5.4381 and a maximum value of 7.3062, indicating that there is a significant difference in the minimum wage across different regions. The proxy variable for internal income disparity within enterprises has a maximum value of 4.043 and a minimum value of 0.0135, with an average of 1.541, suggesting that there is a considerable gap in the internal income levels of the sample companies. The distribution characteristics of other control variables are generally in line with a normal distri-bution and are similar to those in previous research literature. 4.2.Baseline results To explore the impact of minimum wage on the internal income disparity, the following econometric model is constructed: Gapit/uni003D/uni03B10/uni002B/uni03B11Mwageit/uni002B/uni2211.display/uni03B1cControlsit/uni002B/uni03B4i/uni002B/uni03BCt/uni002B/uni03B5it(1) In this equation, Gapit is the proxy variable for the internal income of the sample enterprises, Minwageit represents the minimum wage level in the region where the enterprise is located. Controlsit represents the control variables included in the study, /uni03B10 is the intercept term, /uni03B11 is the coefficient of primary interest to be estimated in this paper. /uni03BCt is the time fixed effect, /uni03B4i is the industry fixed effect, /uni03B5it is the residual.

4industry effects, while column (2) includes regression results that also incorporate control variables at the financial performance and corporate governance levels. The regression results indicate that the minimum wage in the location of the enterprise has a regression coefficient on the internal income disparity of the enterprise that is significantly negative at the 1 % level. This suggests that higher minimum wage standards in the location of the enterprise are conducive to reducing the internal income disparity within the enterprise. 4.3.Cross-sectional analysis 4.3.1.Marketization heterogeneity Our empirical findings suggest that higher minimum wage standards contribute to reducing income disparities within enterprises. Yet, the extent of this impact can vary based on the region’s level of marketization, considering the unique economic characteristics and market dynamics of each area. In regions with high marketization levels, characterized by competitive labor markets, enterprises are more likely to increase minimum wages to attract and retain skilled employees. This environment potentially amplifies the effect of minimum wage standards in narrowing internal income gaps within these enterprises. On the contrary, in areas with lower market-ization levels, where labor market competition is less intense, the response of enterprises to changes in minimum wage standards tends to be more conservative. In such settings, the influence of minimum wage adjustments on reducing income disparities might be comparatively muted. Furthermore, regional variations in the cost of living and industrial structures also play a crucial role. In areas with higher living costs, there’s a tendency to elevate minimum wage levels to align with these costs, while in regions with lower living expenses, the adjustments in minimum wage standards could be more restrained. Therefore, the relationship between minimum wage standards and internal income disparities in enterprises is nuanced and influenced by regional marketization levels, cost of living, and industrial characteristics. This highlights the importance of considering regional economic contexts when evaluating the effectiveness of minimum wage policies. Based on this, the paper refers to the marketization index of China (Wang et al., 2021), grouping the samples according to the median of the annual industry. Groups above the annual industry median are classified as high marketization level groups, and vice versa for low marketization level groups. The group test results, as shown in Table 3, indicate that the restraining effect of the minimum wage on the internal income disparity exists only in regions with a lower level of marketization, and the dif-ference in coefficients between groups is significant at the 1 % level. This indicates that in regions with a lower level of marketization, the minimum wage standard has a more pronounced effect on reducing the internal income disparity within enterprises.

54.3.2.Corporate size heterogeneity The impact of minimum wage standards on reducing internal income disparities within enterprises may differ according to the size of the enterprise. Firstly, large-scale enterprises usually have more comprehensive compensation systems and management structures, allowing them to respond more flexibly to changes in minimum wage standards. In such cases, large enterprises may more easily narrow income disparities through internal compensation adjustments because they have more salary management tools and re-sources. Conversely, small-scale enterprises may be more significantly impacted when facing adjustments in minimum wage standards. Due to limited resources, small enterprises may face greater difficulties in adapting to higher minimum wage standards, making it challenging to achieve flexible adjustments in their compensation systems. This may lead to a relatively weaker effect of minimum wage standards on reducing income disparities within small-scale enterprises. Additionally, the size of the enterprise also affects employees’ promotion and career development opportunities. Large-scale enterprises typically offer more opportunities for advancement and career paths, which can help reduce pay disparities between internal employees. In contrast, small-scale enterprises may have fewer opportunities for promotion due to their smaller size, potentially leading to relatively larger income disparities. Based on this, the paper groups the sample companies according to whether their size is above the median for the industry. Companies larger than the industry median are classified as large-scale enterprises, and vice versa for small-scale enterprises. The group test results, as shown in Table 4, indicate that the restraining effect of minimum wages on internal income disparity exists only in small-scale en-terprises, and the difference in coefficients between groups is significant at the 1 % level. This suggests that in small-scale enterprises, the minimum wage standard has a more pronounced effect on reducing internal income disparities. 5.Conclusion The establishment of minimum wage standards is a multifaceted endeavor that necessitates balancing the interests of workers and the economic viability of businesses. Implementing these standards serves as a critical tool for promoting social equity by narrowing the wealth gap and enhancing the living standards of the workforce. Additionally, recognizing the dynamic nature of socio-economic conditions, it is essential that minimum wage levels are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect the evolving needs of different eras. The research presented in this paper sheds light on the significant role of minimum wage standards in mitigating income dis-parities within companies. Notably, our heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of minimum wage in reducing internal wage gaps is particularly marked in enterprises operating in regions with lower levels of marketization and in smaller-sized businesses. This finding underscores the varied effectiveness of minimum wage policies across different economic contexts and organizational scales, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in setting and implementing these standards.

 Abstract Instead of merely setting a lower bound on the wages of formal 
 sector workers, minimum wages serve as a norm for wage setting more 
 generally throughout the Mexican economy. Our results suggest that wages are 
 commonly set at multiples of the minimum wage, and that changes in minimum 
 wages influence wage changes across the occupational distribution. Moreover, 
 our findings suggest that these normative features of minimum wages have their 
 greatest impact on the mid-to-lower tail of the wage distribution, including the 
 informal sector of the economy. Thus, the results lend support to the view that 
 declining real minimum wages and stabilization programs that strengthened the 
 link between wage levels, wage changes, and minimum wages, might account 
 for a portion of the growing wage inequality in Mexico over the period of the 
 late 1980s and early 1990s.

 INTRODUCTION 
 Research on the impact of minimum wage policies in Mexico has typically 
 concluded that they have little if any effect on the structure of wages. The 
 informal sector of the economy is thought to be mostly immune to 
 government regulations of this sort. Whereas in the formal sector, where 
 mandated wage minimums are expected to have their greatest impact, 
 research suggests that wage levels tend to be well above the minimum, there 
 is no significant spike or clustering in the distribution around the minimum,

 REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY 
 and the variation in minimum wages over time accounts for none of the inter 
 temporal variation in either wages or employment (Bell 1997).1 
 Our data confirm many of these empirical regularities regarding labor 
 market outcomes in Mexico. For example, in our data only 5 percent of 
 formal sector workers earned less than the minimum wage in 1984, and only 
 2.5 percent earned less than the minimum in 1992.2 Moreover, we find little 
 evidence of a sizeable spike or clustering of workers around the minimum 
 wage in the formal sector. However, our empirical results are not supportive 
 of the view that minimum wages have no impact on the wage structure in 
 Mexico. We find strong evidence of clustering around multiples of the 
 minimum wage, and some evidence to suggest that wage increases over time 
 for certain occupations follow stipulated increases in the minimum wage. 
 Indeed, there is much anecdotal evidence to suggest that minimum wages 
 play precisely this kind of normative role in overall wage setting in Mexico. 
 We are unaware of any existing empirical analyses that formally link 
 observed clustering in wage distributions to minimum wage multiples in 
 Mexico. Maloney and Nunez (2003) offer evidence of clustering in the wage 
 distributions of many Latin American countries, and suggest that this 
 clustering may be explained by the fact that the minimum wage serves as a 
 "numeraire" for wage and price setting more generally throughout the 
 economies of this region. However, they do not establish an empirical 
 relationship between the observed clustering and minimum wage multiples. 
 In an in-depth analysis of the impact of the minimum wage on the wage 
 distribution in Columbia, the authors find that minimum wage changes affect 
 a significant range of the lower tail of the wage distribution, which is 
 suggestive of "numeraire" effects and not mere general equilibrium 
 adjustment.3 
 Our results, for Mexico, also suggest that the normative impact of the 
 minimum wage is most significant for the lower tail of the wage distribution. 
 1 Bell's analysis utilizes panel data on a select set of formal sector firms. A similar analysis, but with a  different, less-privileged set of formal sector firms, finds evidence of a significant employment impact of  minimum wages (Feliciano 1998). And, indeed, Bell's own analysis suggests that, although few formal  sector firms possess average wages that are less than the minimum wage, there is a significant number of  workers in the formal sector who earn less than the minimum. While Bell views this as an indication that 
 minimum wage policies might affect formal sector wages, others see this as evidence that minimum wage  regulations are not well enforced even in the formal sector (Bravo and Vial 1997).  2 By way of comparison, the corresponding figures for the US are 11 percent for 1984 and 7.7 percent for  1992 (Source: US Census Bureau, Minimum Wage 2004, Table 10).  3 A minimum wage increase may elicit general equilibrium effects on wages both above and below the  minimum as workers who are displaced from the covered sector seek work and thereby depress wages in  the uncovered sector, or as firms substitute for higher-skilled labor and thereby raise the wages of higher  paid workers in the covered sector.

 THE WAGE STRUCTURE IN MEXICO 
 The lower tail of the distribution appears to be directly linked to multiples of 
 the minimum wage, and wage changes for occupations in this tail of the 
 distribution follow more closely changes in minimum wages. This linkage 
 suggests that the declining real value of the minimum wage in Mexico over 
 the past two decades might account for a portion of the growing wage 
 inequality in that country over the same period.4 
 The outline of the paper is as follows. In the next section, we discuss 
 anecdotal evidence suggesting that minimum wages serve a normative role in 
 overall wage setting in Mexico. In the third section, we ofTer an empirical 
 exploration of this normative feature of minimum wages. There we present 
 evidence to suggest that wages are indeed set as multiples of the minimum 
 wage, especially for workers in the lower tail of the wage distribution. While 
 our data do not allow great insight into the relationship between changes in 
 wages and changes in minimum wages over time, some evidence on this 
 aspect of the normative role of minimum wages in Mexico is offered in the 
 fourth section of the paper. In the fifth section we offer suggestive evidence of 
 the link between changing wage inequality over the period of the 1980s and 
 early 1990s and the normative role of minimum wages. The final section 
 concludes the paper. 
 THE NORMATIVE ROLE OF MINIMUM WAGES 
 The minimum wage in Mexico is intended to be the wage that would be 
 sufficient to support a worker and his or her family for a day. Minimum wage 
 levels are currently set once a year by a tripartite commission (the Comision 
 Nacional de Salarios Minimos) representing the interests of labor, employ? 
 ers, and the state. Due to substantive economic differences across regions in 
 Mexico, minimum wages have been traditionally set at different levels for 
 different regions. Recently, the number of regions has been streamlined 
 significantly. Minimum wages are also established for trades and types of 
 occupations, including construction workers, cashiers, truck drivers, 
 operators of pressure melting machinery, and attendants at gas stations. 
 There is much institutional evidence to suggest that minimum wages serve 
 as a norm for wage setting at both the micro and macro levels in Mexico. At 
 the micro level, many prices are fixed as multiples or fractions of the 
 4 For a discussion of the extent of wage inequality growth over this period and the factors that might  account for this growth, see Alarcon and McKinley (1997), Fairris (2003) and the references cited therein.  Cortez (2001) offers evidence that declining minimum wages explain part of the growing wage inequality in  Mexico over the period of the 1980s and 1990s, but does not consider the normative aspect of minimum  wages, which is the focus of this paper.

 REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY 
 minimum wage. Moreover, fines, bails, income brackets for income tax rates, 
 eligibility for certain social services (housing credits, for example), bonuses as 
 part of fringe benefits, and productivity bonuses for teachers and university 
 professors are tied to multiples of the minimum wage. In fact, it is fairly 
 common in Mexico to hear workers and employers report wages in multiples 
 of the local wage minimum. Bair and Gereffi's (2001) study of jean 
 production in Torreon notes that many employers offer pay in multiples of 
 the minimum wage. Base pay in the companies they interviewed ranged 
 between 1.25 and 1.5 multiples of the local minimum wage (p. 1898). Thus, it 
 would not be surprising to see wage levels, both above and perhaps even 
 below the minimum, set at multiples or fractions of the minimum wage. 
 Tying wages to multiples of the minimum wage probably began as a 
 mechanism for indexing wages to changes in the cost of living. Over time, 
 however, the established levels may have come to be viewed as norms of 
 fairness in relative pay across occupations in the workplace, and thus agreed 
 to by workers because they are perceived as fair, and by employers because 
 they maintain work norms which are premised on workers' perceptions of 
 fairness in pay.5 
 At a macro level, these normative dynamics can be related in part to the 
 role that minimum wages have played in stabilization policies (in 1977, 1983, 
 1985-1986, 1987-1989, and 1995-1997). Throughout the decades of the 
 1980s and 1990s, the Mexican economy suffered high volatility in inflation 
 and gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates, and stabilization polices 
 were the government's response. In the wake of the 1982 debt crisis, 
 restrictive fiscal and monetary polices were followed, but inflation persisted 
 and GDP growth rates remained low. In December 1987 the government 
 began exchange rate management (the nominal peso-dollar exchange rate 
 was fixed), increased the pace of trade liberalization, and initiated incomes 
 policies taking the form of wage and price controls (Messmacher 2002). 
 Under these incomes policies, changes in minimum wages have been 
 systematically used as signals to indicate acceptable changes in wages more 
 generally (Woodruff 1999). Policy makers were interested in directly 
 controlling wage increases as a way of quelling increases in commodity 
 and service prices and as a tool to avoid increases in government payroll 
 expenses. As part of these stabilization programs, minimum wages were set 
 5 Wages being determined by "norms" is a well established concept in economics. A classic reference is  Akerlof (1982). Levin-Waldman (2002) makes a case for minimum wages serving as a reference point for  firms' internal wage structures in the US. Living wage advocates have also made reference to "social  norms," "fairness," and "ethics" as important determinants in the wage setting process (Robinson 2004;  Prasch and Sheth 1999; Pollin and Luce 1998).

 according to carefully calculated desired changes in prices and subject to 
 budgetary adjustments. The negotiated increases in minimum wage levels 
 were then supposed guide wage negotiations throughout the economy. The 
 objective was to break "inertial inflation" (Lustig 1998)?that is, to reduce 
 "inflation expectations." These measures are typically part of an overall 
 social agreement involving workers and business representatives along with 
 government officials at the highest rank. The best known of such agreements 
 are the various Pactos de Solidaridad of 1987 to 1994.6 
 Setting wages at minimum wage multiples is arguably more acceptable and 
 meaningful for low-skill workers than for high-skill workers. Enforcement of 
 stabilization policies is also arguably easier for low-skill workers than for 
 high-skill workers. Woodruff (1999) finds, for example, that wage drift away 
 from stabilization targets in Mexico was much greater for white-collar 
 workers than for blue-collar workers during the late 1980s and early 1990s. 
 This suggests that we might expect the influence of the minimum wage as a 
 reference price for labor to diminish in the upper tail of the wage distribution. 
 EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS 
 Data
 The data used for the empirical analysis come from the Comision Nacional 
 de Salarios Mmimos and from the Encuesta Nacional de Ingresos y Gastos 
 de los Hogares (ENIGH) for the years 1984, 1989, and 1992. We focus 
 specifically on the period of the late 1980s and the early 1990s because this 
 was one of dramatic reductions in real minimum wage levels in Mexico 
 (Feliciano 1998).7 Stabilization polices were also especially prominent in 
 Mexico during the late 1980s and the early 1990s (Messmacher 2002).8 
 The ENIGH is a national household survey of similar format for the years 
 1984, 1989, 1992, and every two years thereafter. Each survey is a stratified 
 sample based on city size, with a similar sampling distribution across the 
 survey years, and with weights that render the sample representative of the 
 national experience. 
 6 Freeman (1993) cites the need for further research on the impact of stabilization policies on wages in  developing countries.  7 From the mid 1980s to the mid 1990s the real value of the minimum wage in Mexico declined by 54  percent, but by only about 2 percent thereafter until 1999 (source: Table 20, The Mexican Economy 1996  and 1999, Banco de Mexico).  8 Castellanos et al. (2004) in their paper on nominal wage rigidities in Mexico conclude that the wage  rigidities and the effects of minimum wage were most prominent in the country during the late 1980s and  the early 1990s.

 REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY 
 The sample utilized in this analysis is of working individuals who are 16 years 
 of age or older. The earnings variable is the hourly wage and is computed from 
 reported earnings during the month before the survey and reported hours 
 worked in the last week. No fringe benefits, tips, bonuses or commissions are 
 included in the wage measure. To ensure an accurate measure of the wage, all 
 those who are self-employed or working without pay are excluded from the 
 sample. We also exclude from the analysis all those who hold more than one 
 job.
 The data for daily minimum wages come from the Comision Nacional de 
 Salarios Minimos. For each year of our survey we pick the minimum wage 
 level corresponding to the timing of the ENIGH survey. For example, the 
 1984 ENIGH survey was conducted from July to December and so we use 
 the minimum wage level adopted on 11 July. 
 Over the years of our analysis, the country was divided into different 
 economic zones and a minimum wage was set for each economic zone. In 1984 
 there were 11 economic zones, and by 1992 there were only three. Some states 
 in Mexico possess more than one economic zone. This presents a problem for 
 our analysis because the ENIGH data allow us to locate only the state of 
 residence of respondents. We are thus unable to associate a unique minimum 
 wage to every individual in our sample. The analyzed sample therefore 
 contains only people for whom we can assign a unique minimum wage. Using 
 this selection criterion we have individuals from thirteen states,9 encompass? 
 ing three economic zones in 1984. For 1992, we have individuals from 25 
 states (this includes all the 13 states of 1984),10 encompassing two economic 
 zones. We have defined the zones consistently over the two years; however 
 two of the economic zones from 1984 were collapsed into one zone in 1992 due 
 to further reductions in the number of minimum wage regions in Mexico.11 
 Table 1 gives the hourly minimum wage levels (computed as the daily 
 minimum wage divided by eight, the stipulated length of the workday) for the 
 three economic zones in our analysis for 1984 and 1992, along with the mean 
 wage in each zone or region from our sample. 
 9 The 13 states are: Aguascalientes, Baja California?Norte, Baja California?Sur, Campeche, Colima,  Distrito Federal, Morelos, Nayarit, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Tabasco, Tlaxcala, and Zacatecas.  10 The additional 12 states are: Coahuila, Chiapas, Durango, Hidalgo, Mexico, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Puebla,  Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, and Yucatan.  11 In 1984, our Zone A includes the states of Campeche and Zacatecas; Zone B includes the states of  Aquascalientes, Colima, Morelos, Nayarit, Quintana Roo, Sinaloa, Tabasco, and Tlaxcala; and Zone C  includes the states of Baja California Norte, Baja California Sur, and the Distrito Federal. In 1992, the  states from our 1984 Zone A and B are combined along with the states of Coahuila, Chiapas, Durango,  Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Estado de Mexico, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Puebla, Queretaro, San Luis Potosi, and  Yucatan to form one zone, and Zone C remains the same.

 Minimum Wages and the Wage Structure 
 To see how minimum wage norms may affect the wage distribution, we begin 
 the analysis by presenting nonparametric kernel density estimates of the 
 cumulative wage distributions for our data. The kernel density estimate /(x) 
 of a univariate unknown density f(x), based on a random sample X\^_^Xn 
 of size n is given as f(x) ? 1/^SLi ^(nrO- Where K(.) is the Gaussian 
 kernel weight function that depends on the distance of Xt from x and the 
 sample size through A, the window width given by A = \.06<rxn~1/5, ax is the 
 standard deviation of the random sample. From the estimated distribution 
 the cumulative can be obtained as: 
 %*) = E/W-12 
 t<x
 The cumulative wage distributions for 1984 and 1992 are presented in 
 Figures 1 and 2 respectively. The most notable characteristic of these distri? 
 butions with regard to the subject of this paper is the existence of significant 
 clustering at certain intervals in the distributions.13 In Figures 3 through 7 we

 Chapter 2).  13 The clustering we observe is not due to rounding in either reported monthly income or hours worked.  Within a given hourly wage cluster we observe numerous values for monthly income and hours worked.

 Figure 3: Cumulative Distribution of Wages 1984 Zone A 
 of both the hourly wage (which is derived from information on monthly 
 labor income and hours worked in the previous week) and the hourly 
 minimum wage (which is the official daily minimum divided by eight), even if 
 minimum wage policies account for the wage clusters, it is reasonable to 
 expect the wage clusters and minimum wage multiples to be less than perfect 
 matches. 
 In our view, the matches are surprising for both their extent and accuracy. 
 In 1984, for example, the largest clusters in the wage distributions match up 
 perfectly with minimum wage multiples, except in Figure 5 where the 
 "matches" are close but not exact. The graphs reveal some clustering around 
 the minimum wage, but these are far from the most sizeable clusters in the 
 graphs. Moreover, matches exist both above and below the wage minimum. 
 Finally, and somewhat more speculatively, it appears that the extent of 
 matching diminishes as one moves out towards the upper tails of the wage 
 distributions. 
 The evidence is very similar for the 1992 distributions in Figures 6 and 7, 
 with a couple of important exceptions. First, it appears as though the extent 
 of matching is even greater for this year than for 1984. This may be related to 
 the highly significant and widely publicized stabilization agreements of the 
 late 1980s, which may have served to reinforce minimum wage multiples as

 REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY 
 Some of the matching we observe between minimum wage multiples and 
 wage clusters may be due to occupational minimum wages, a portion of 
 which are set at exact or near multiples of the general minimum wage. In 
 1993, for example, 45 of the 88 occupational minimum wages in Zone C fell 
 within a 5 percent range around multiples of the minimum wage.14 This is yet 
 another example of how the minimum wage serves as a reference price for 
 wage setting above the minimum. 
 Our data lack occupational categories at the level of detail for which 
 occupational minimum wages are defined, and so we cannot say to what 
 extent these occupational minimum wages are binding for relevant groups of 
 workers. If the occupational minimum wages were primarily responsible for 
 the matching we observe between multiples of the minimum wage and wage 
 clusters in the figures, our contention that general minimum wages serve as a 
 norm for wage setting above the minimum would be undercut. The matches 
 would be explained by occupational minimum wage requirements, not 
 formal or informal wage setting norms. It is clear from the figures, however, 
 that this is not the case. None of the occupational minimum wages exceeds 
 two times the minimum wage, and the matches at two times the minimum 
 wage or lower are by no means the dominant matches in these figures. In 
 fact, the most significant matches, in terms of both numbers and the size of 
 the wage cluster, occur in the mid-to-lower range of the distribution?above 
 two and below four times the minimum wage. 
 The graphs give a visual depiction of the amount of clustering in the data 
 and the extent to which multiples of minimum wages match up with these 
 clusters. Table 2 offers a numerical depiction of the extent of matching 
 between multiples of the minimum wage and wages. It does so under three 
 different assumptions regarding errors in measurement. If there were no 
 errors in measuring either hourly minimum wages or hourly wages, the 
 hourly wage would have to be exactly equal to a multiple of the hourly 
 minimum wage in order to be legitimately labeled a match. The numbers in 
 column (1) invoke this assumption. However, given that both hourly 
 minimum wages and hourly wages are measured with some imprecision, we 
 might also label as a match those instances in which the two are equal to one 
 another but within some fixed band of error. 
 In columns (2) and (3), we allow for fixed bands of error of +0.025 and 
 + 0.05 respectively. In constructing the bands, we have done the following: 
 14 Of these 45, 17 were within 5 percent of 1.25 times the minimum wage, 24 within 5 percent of 1.5 times the  minimum wage, 2 within 5 percent of 1.75 times the minimum, and 2 within 5 percent of 2 times the  minimum wage.

 let Wf be the wage of individual / in any one of the economic zones and MW 
 be the minimum wage of that economic zone. We define Di=Wi/MW. 
 If D 1 = 0.25 then Wt is an exact 0.25 multiple of the MW. However, because 
 of potential measurement error in the data, we consider instances where the 
 matches are not exact, but rather exist within fixed bands of error. For 
 example, the ?0.05 band means that if Dt e (0.2, 0.3) then we consider Wt as 
 a 0.25 multiple of the MW. 
 A cluster is defined as a grouping of workers earning the same hourly wage

 threshold by invoking a series of proportions tests. Suppose that at wage Wt

 particular wage. We do the same for the next largest proportion in the 
 sample, and if that is also significantly different from all the remaining 
 proportions in the sample then we call that a cluster as well. This test is 
 repeated recursively until we arrive at a cluster that is not statistically 
 significantly different from all remaining clusters in the sample. Utilizing this 
 test, the 2 percent threshold is if anything conservative.15 
 Using the above definition of a cluster, there are 18 clusters in 1984 and 13 
 clusters in 1992. The column (1) results show that 17 percent of these clusters 
 match 0.25 multiples of minimum wages in 1984, but that there are no exact 
 matches in 1992. However, allowing for a fixed band of error in the matching 
 process, the percentage of matches rises to 44 percent in 1984 and 69 percent 
 in 1992 using a ? 0.0025 band, and to 72 percent and 77 percent in respective 
 years using a ?0.05 band. 
 In the final three rows of results for each year we give the incidence of 
 matches in the sample, whether part of a cluster or not, and the percentage of 
 the entire sample that is matched (the proportion of the sample earning the 
 minimum wage or some multiple of it). Here, we ignore the issue of clusters 
 and inquire about the extent of matching in the overall sample. Once again, 
 we do this under different assumptions regarding the extent of measurement 
 error in the data. About 3 percent of the sample in 1984 has a wage that is an 
 exact multiple of the minimum wage, while for 1992 there are no exact 
 matches. Allowing for a fixed band of error of ?0.0025 yields an increase in 
 the percentage of the sample matched to 24 percent and 30 percent in 
 respective years. And finally, for the larger fixed band of ?0.05, almost 44 
 percent of the sample in 1984 and 45 percent of the sample in 1992 has a 
 wage that is a multiple of the minimum wage. 
 The visual depictions and descriptive statistics lend support to the view 
 that minimum wages act as a reference price for labor in Mexico in that there 
 appears to be a significant amount of matching between minimum wage 
 multiples and wages. However, it is also important to ask whether these 
 matches are significant in a statistical sense. We indicate with an asterisk in 
 Table 2 those instances in which statistical tests revealed the matches to be 
 significantly different from zero. The proportion of clusters matched and the 
 proportion of samples matched in Table 2 were significantly different from 
 zero in every instance in which we allow for a margin of error in the matching 
 process. 
 15 According to the statistical procedure, the 2 percent threshold is just about right for the 1984 data, but it is  far too conservative for the 1992 data, where a much lower threshold for defining a cluster would pass a  test of statistical significance.

 THE WAGE STRUCTURE IN MEXICO 
 A visual inspection of the graphs reveals not only that hourly wages cluster 
 around multiples of the minimum wage, but that this matching of clusters 
 and minimum wage multiples exists both above and below the stipulated 
 minimum. Because so few formal sector workers receive wages below the 
 minimum wage, this raises an issue of the normative influence of minimum 
 wages on pay in the informal sector, which, in the conventional view, is 
 presumed to be immune to minimum wage policies. We replicated the graphs 
 and descriptive statistics presented above for the formal and informal sectors 
 separately.16 They reveal that the normative impact of minimum wages on 
 the wage structure is as significant in the informal sector as it is in the formal 
 sector. 
 The cumulative wage distributions for the formal and informal sectors 
 suggest just as much clustering and matching of clusters with minimum 
 wage multiples in the informal sector as in the formal sector. This is 
 confirmed in the descriptive statistics shown in Table 3, where, in the 
 informal sector for the year 1984, the number of clusters, the proportion 
 of matched clusters and the proportion of matches in the overall sample 
 generally exceed those in the formal sector. In 1992, while the number of 
 clusters is larger in the informal sector, the proportion of matched clusters 
 and the proportion of matches in the overall sample are generally greater 
 in the formal sector. 
 A final, and somewhat more speculative, conclusion one might draw from 
 the graphs of cumulative wage distributions in Figures 3-7 is that the 
 matching between wages and minimum wage multiples is more pronounced 
 in the mid-to-lower tails of the distributions. If true, this would indicate that 
 the normative role of minimum wages in the Mexican economy has a greater 
 impact on low-wage workers than on high-wage workers, and, somewhat 
 more speculatively, that changes in minimum wage policies might therefore 
 have a significant impact on wage inequality. 
 One way to subject this issue to the rigors of statistical testing is by 
 investigating statistical correlation. Suppose we utilize the data on the wages 
 of individuals to create a dichotomous variable that equals 1 if the individual 
 is paid a multiple of the minimum wage and 0 if not.17 We can then ask 
 whether there is any correlation between this variable and the wages of 
 individuals. A negative and significant correlation would indicate that 
 matches are statistically more likely to be found among low-wage workers. 
 16 We define formal sector workers as those who qualify for certain state-provided social benefits, the costs of  which are partially paid for by registered employers.  17 We use the +0.05 band of error in labeling the wage and multiples of the minimum wage a "match."

 THE WAGE STRUCTURE IN MEXICO 
 suggest that the pay of low-skill workers is more likely to be influenced by 
 minimum wage norms than is the pay of high-skill workers. 
 CHANGING MINIMUM WAGE LEVELS AND CHANGING WAGES 
 There is a second way in which minimum wages might serve as a norm for 
 wage setting in Mexico?annual changes in minimum wage levels might form 
 the basis for wage changes more generally throughout the economy. Indeed, 
 this was an explicit goal of the various stabilization programs Mexico 
 undertook during the late 1980s to quell inflationary pressures. Obviously, if 
 informal wage norms tie wages to specific multiples of the minimum wage, as 
 we argue above, and this multiple remains constant over time, then some wage 
 changes will indeed accord precisely with minimum wage changes. Moreover, 
 given evidence that this normative effect has a greater impact on the lower 
 tail of the wage distribution, the declining real value of the minimum wage in 
 Mexico might be expected to account for some of the growing wage 
 inequality we observe over this period. 
 However, wages do not seem to be tied to unchanging multiples of the 
 minimum wage during these years. The modal minimum wage multiple in 
 1984 was 1.25, whereas by 1992 it had risen to 1.75. We believe the reason for 
 this is that the real value of the minimum wage declined so dramatically over 
 these years that, to maintain adequate labor supply and a basic standard of 
 living for low-skill workers, employers had to either adjust upward the 
 multiples of the minimum wage to which they adhered or abandon the norm 
 altogether. The results in Table 2 suggest that employers did not entirely 
 abandon the norm in the later period. The rising modal minimum wage 
 multiple cited above suggests that some merely adjusted upward the 
 normative multiple. Because stabilization policies were also in effect over 
 this period, linking changes in the minimum wage to wage changes more 
 generally throughout the wage distribution, there remains the question of 
 whether minimum wage changes had a greater impact on the lower tail of the 
 wage distribution. 
 Preliminary evidence on this second normative role of minimum wages can 
 be found in an across-zone comparison of changes over time in minimum 
 wage levels and accompanying changes in the average wages of particular 
 groups of workers. We are able to compute average wage changes for various 
 groups of workers?for union and nonunion workers, formal and informal 
 sector workers, and for certain occupational categories, for instance?with 
 the 1984, 1989, and 1992 survey data. How do changes in average wages for 
 these worker groups accord with changes over time in minimum wages?

 REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY 
 An important channel through which minimum wages might influence 
 wages is that the percentage change agreed to in minimum wage agreements 
 becomes the benchmark, if not the rule, for collective bargaining outcomes in 
 the union sector. Labor negotiations in unionized labor markets are subject 
 to approval by government arbitration boards, allowing for greater 
 enforcement of stabilization policies limiting wage increases to stipulated 
 increases in the wage minimum in this sector as compared, say, to the 
 nonunion sector. Greater enforcement might also be expected in the formal 
 sector of the economy as compared with the informal sector. 
 When we conduct this exercise for both union and nonunion workers and 
 formal and informal sector workers, nothing very striking emerges. In 
 Table 4A, the economic zones are ranked from 1 to 3 according to the extent 
 of increase in minimum wages (1 being the largest), and these various worker 
 groups are similarly ranked according to the extent of wage increase for each 
 group across zones. If the wages of union and formal sector workers follow 
 more closely changes in minimum wages than do the wages of nonunion and 
 informal sector workers, then the ranking of wage changes for the former 
 groups should more closely approximate the ranking of minimum wage 
 changes. This is not the case. 
 However, stabilization programs in Mexico during this period date from 
 the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Are our results altered if we limit the 
 analysis to the period 1989 to 1992? The results are shown in Table 4B. Over 
 this more restricted time period, wages do appear to follow more closely

 changes in minimum wage levels across zones for both union and formal 
 sector workers. However, this is true for nonunion workers as well. Indeed, 
 the only sector where wage increases are not linked with increases in the 
 minimum wage is the informal sector of the economy. These findings give 
 suggestive evidence to the claim that stabilization programs were successful 
 in restraining wage increases in all but the informal sector during the period 
 of the late 1980s and early 1990s. They also suggest that the second 
 normative role of minimum wages operates through government enforce? 
 ment of policy measures as well as through informal norms hammered out by 
 firms and workers. 
 The above exercise makes use of very few observations, thereby limiting 
 our ability to draw strong conclusions. The number of observations can be 
 increased substantially, however, if we focus on occupational categories. In 
 Table 5, we rank on a scale from 1 to 3 the changes in minimum wage levels 
 across the three economic zones (1 being the largest) and the corresponding 
 ranking of changes in average occupational wages across these zones for the 
 eleven 2-digit occupational codes for which we have information from the 
 surveys. Note that if minimum wage changes across economic zones reflected 
 only differences in the increased cost-of-living, we would expect the rankings 
 of all occupational wage changes to be similar to the rankings of minimum 
 wage changes. They are not, which suggests that minimum wage changes 
 may serve as a norm for wage changes across occupational groups, and do so 
 with differential impact across the occupational, and thus wage distribution.

 Among the four occupational groups whose ranking of wage changes 
 match perfectly the ranking of minimum wage changes across zones are 
 agricultural workers, personal service workers, and transportation workers. 
 Workers in these three occupational categories fall disproportionately into 
 the mid-to-lower tail of the overall wage distribution. Thus, these results 
 offer suggestive evidence that minimum wage changes have their greatest 
 impact on low-skill and low-paid workers. 
 In Tables 6A and 6B, we explore this aspect a bit further. Suppose we 
 rank, within each zone, the occupations from lowest to highest (1 being 
 lowest and 11 being highest) in terms of hourly pay in 1984.18 And suppose 
 we assign, within each zone, a value from 1 to 11 to each of these 
 occupational categories, reflecting the proximity?furthest equaling 1 and 
 18 The rankings of occupations are not exactly the same across zones, although they are roughly similar. For  example, the lowest paid occupation is the same across all three zones, as is the highest paid occupation. In  between, the ordering follows a general pattern, but is not exactly the same.

 closest equaling 11?of the wage change for that occupation to the actual 
 percentage change in the minimum wage level for that zone. Finally, suppose 
 we then add these numbers across the zones for each occupational ranking. If 
 minimum wage changes act as a norm for wage changes, and they do so more 
 for the lower tail of the wage distribution than the upper tail, then the sums 
 should be higher for the lowest paid occupational groups. 
 The pattern we observe in the final columns of Tables 6A and 6B is 
 reflective of just such an effect. The simple correlation between the rankings 
 in the first column and the sums in the last column is -0.42 for the period 
 1984 to 1992, and -0.56 for the stabilization period of the late 1980s and 
 early 1990s (both statistically significant at the 0.10 level, one-tailed test). 
 This suggests that wage changes are more closely aligned to changes in the 
 minimum wage for low-skill workers. Focusing on the specific patterns in 
 the last columns, it appears that the normative impact is most prominent in 
 the mid-to-lower tail of the pay distribution.

 MINIMUM WAGE NORMS AND CHANGING WAGE INEQUALITY 
 Evidence suggests that the declining real value of the US minimum wage 
 during the 1980s accounts for a significant portion of the growing wage 
 inequality in this country (DiNardo et al. 1996; Fortin and Lemieux 1997). 
 The argument for the US, however, is typically one of general equilibrium 
 adjustment (Grossman 1983; Card and Krueger 1995)?the minimum wage 
 is binding for low-wage workers, and changes in the minimum wage 
 primarily affect this group of workers and perhaps a small number of other 
 workers in the lower tail of the wage distribution through labor substitution 
 effects. Our analysis suggests that in Mexico, by contrast, while the minimum 
 wage is not especially binding at the level of the minimum, it serves as a 
 powerful norm for wage setting beyond the level of the minimum. Thus, 
 when real minimum wages decline, in the US it is the workers earning around 
 the minimum wage who suffer a wage loss, whereas in Mexico wages decline

 for a much larger portion of the lower tail of the wage distribution?i.e. that 
 portion for which minimum wages serve as a wage setting norm.19 
 In this section we offer further evidence on the effect of minimum wage 
 norms on changing wage inequality in Mexico over the period of the 1980s 
 and 1990s. Figure 8 shows the trajectory of the real value of the minimum 
 wage and the coefficient of variation (a common measure of wage 
 dispersion)20 over these years. The results are suggestive: wage dispersion 
 rises significantly when the real value of the minimum wage is falling, but 
 levels off in the mid-1990s, just as the decline in minimum wages is abated. 
 There are alternative explanations for the observed trajectory in wage 
 inequality over this period (see, for example, Fairris 2003 and Behrman et al. 
 2000) but its synchronization with changes in the real value of the minimum 
 wage is telling.

 19 This is not to say that spillover effects are nonexistent in the US, but rather that they are generally much  smaller (Brown 1999), limited to those at or near the minimum wage with little effect as one moves up the  wage distribution (Neumark et al. 2004) and are normatively unrelated to minimum wage levels.  20 The results of this analysis and those that follow in this section are unchanged if, instead, either the Gini  coefficient or the standard deviation of the log of wages is used as a measure of dispersion.

 REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY 
 inequality over this period, they do allow a few further insights into the 
 possibility of such a link. We established results earlier in the paper that 
 minimum wage norms have their impact on the mid-to-lower tail of the wage 
 distribution. This suggests a hypothesis about the nature of changing wage 
 inequality over the period. If the link between minimum wage norms and 
 changing wage inequality has validity, wage inequality should evolve in the 
 following manner: (a) there should be relative stasis in wage dispersion for 
 that portion of the wage distribution that is affected by minimum wage 
 norms and rising dispersion among the unaffected portion of the distribution, 
 and (b) there should be declining real wages for that portion of the wage 
 distribution affected by minimum wage norms and perhaps steady or even 
 rising real wages for the unaffected portion. These hypotheses are tested 
 below. 
 We begin by apportioning workers in each of the two minimum wage 
 zones existing in 1992 into "affected" and "unaffected" groups for the years 
 1984 and 1992. In each case, the affected group is composed of those workers 
 who earn a wage less than or equal to the highest multiple of the minimum 
 wage for which our earlier analysis established a significant clustering of 
 wage observations and a match between that wage observation and a 
 minimum wage multiple. For both zones in both years, we apportion in this 
 way first the employed labor force as a whole and then the formal sector 
 labor force, and then compare changes in wage dispersion and average wages 
 across affected and unaffected worker groups.21 The results are shown in 
 Tables 7 and 8. 
 Table 7 reveals that wage dispersion grew much more significantly among 
 the unaffected portion of the wage distribution than among workers affected 
 by minimum wage norms over this period. Indeed, the results are rather 
 striking: in both zones the percentage change in dispersion in the unaffected 
 group is at least three times that of the affected group. This is precisely what 
 we would expect to find if the wage distribution among affected workers is 
 normatively shaped by minimum wages. 
 A second prediction is that the average real wage of affected workers 
 should decline, perhaps absolutely as did minimum wages, but certainly 
 relative to the average wage of workers in the unaffected group. The results in 
 Table 8 reveal this to be the case. Affected workers' wages declined in every 
 case, both in real terms and in relation to the wages of unaffected workers. 
 21 Unaffected workers make up a very small segment of the informal sector workforce. In the formal sector,  the unaffected segment represents roughly 25 percent of the upper tail of the wage distribution in both 
 zones.

 REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY 
 Once again, the results are striking: among formal sector workers, the 
 average real wage of affected workers declined 10-20 percent across zones, 
 whereas the wages of unaffected workers rose by 20-50 percent. 
 While not definitive, the results of this analysis offer suggestive evidence 
 that minimum wage norms do indeed account for some of the rise in wage 
 inequality over the period of the 1980s and early 1990s. Part of the increased 
 inequality is attributable to increased dispersion among workers unaffected 
 by minimum wage norms and part, to the growing separation between the 
 real wages of affected and unaffected workers. 
 CONCLUSION 
 This paper presents a different view of the relationship between minimum 
 wages and the wage structure in Mexico than is common in the literature. 
 Instead of merely setting a lower bound on the wages of formal sector 
 workers, minimum wages serve as a norm for wage setting both above and 
 below the level of the minimum. In particular, our empirical evidence 
 suggests that wages are often set at multiples of the minimum wage, and that 
 minimum wage changes affect occupational wages unevenly across the 
 occupational distribution. Indeed, the findings suggest that these two 
 normative roles of minimum wages have their greatest impact on the mid 
 to-lower tail of the wage distribution. These results lend support to the view 
 that declining real minimum wages and stabilization programs that 
 strengthened the link between wage levels, wage changes, and minimum 
 wages, might account for a portion of the growing wage inequality in Mexico 
 over the period of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

We take advantage of a natural experiment in the minimum wage setting in Russia
to study the employment consequences of large hikes in the minimum wage. In
September 2007, the Russian government raised the federal minimum wage from
1100 to 2300 Rubles and simultaneously gave the regions the power to set their
own minima above the federal threshold. In studying the effect of this reform, we
follow the approach proposed by David Card and compare changes in employment
rates and other labor market outcomes before and after the hike across regions with
different shares of affected workers. We find some evidence of adverse effects of the
2007 hike in the minimum wage on employment. They are mostly visible in lower
employment rates among the youth, as well as the increased informalization of
employment.

1 Introduction
The minimum wage is one of the most controversial issues in labor economics, eco-
nomic policy, and politics. A typical purpose of minimum wage policies is to support
low-wage workers and thereby fight inequality and poverty (Belser and Rani 2015).
Less frequently, minimum wage policies are advocated as a means to correct imperfec-
tions in the labor market, regarding employers ’monopsony power in particular (e.g.,
Boal and Ransom 1997). However, the effectiveness of the minimum wage in achieving
these goals is highly contested. From the theoretical viewpoint, the standard labor sup-
ply and demand model suggests that the minimum wage may increase unemployment,
especially among low-skilled workers (Stigler 1946). There are also concerns that the
minimum wage promotes informalization of the labor market, which is particularly
relevant in the developing world. Moreover, the benefits of the minimum wage in mo-
nopsonistic environments have been questioned in a number of recent contributions,
such as Danziger (2010).
The empirical evidence regarding the employment effects of the minimum wage re-
mains contradictory and inconclusive. For example, the seminal symposium published
in the Industrial and Labor Relations Review (ILLR) in 1992 provided highly conflicting
results regarding this issue. The estimated effect of the minimum wage on the employ-
ment of less-skilled workers ranged from negative (Neumark and Wascher 1992) and

zero (Card 1992) to positive (Katz and Krueger 1992). This controversy continues to
date. For example, Dube et al. (2010) find no disemployment effects in restaurants and
other low-wage sectors in the USA, Dolton et al. (2012) report no or a small positive
impact of the minimum wage on employment in the UK, while Sen et al. (2011) find
significant disemployment effects among teens in Canada. As the most comprehensive
survey of the literature up to 2006, the review study by Neumark and Wascher (2008)
concludes that the minimum wage has a negative effect on the employment opportun-
ities of less-skilled workers and no effect on overall employment. However, Belman and
Wolfson (2014, p. 15) point out that the estimated effects of the minimum wage “are
either statistically nonsignificant or are too small in magnitude to be economically
meaningful ”.
Most empirical papers in this field commonly focus on relatively small increases in
the nominal minimum wage, typically below 20 %. For instance, in the USA, the magni-
tude of the federal minimum wage hikes examined in empirical studies —including
those published in the 1992 special issue of ILLR —did not exceed 30 %. Similarly, each
of the regular increases in the UK minimum wage between 1999 and 2007 did not
exceed 15 % (Dolton et al. 2012). It is plausible that the absence of robust evidence re-
garding the employment effects of the minimum wage stems from this particular fea-
ture of the empirical literature. Indeed, from the theoretical viewpoint, employers ’
adjustment costs may deter them from laying off low-wage workers in response to a
small increase in the minimum wage. From the estimation perspective, small variation
in the minimum wage can complicate econometric identification, especially when mini-
mum wage hikes are regular and expected or when there are measurement errors in
the data.
In this paper, we present new evidence on the employment effects of a large increase
in the minimum wage. We take advantage of a natural experiment that occurred in
Russia in September 2007 when a comprehensive reform of the minimum wage setting
was introduced. Firstly, the federal minimum wage was sharply raised from 1100 to
2300 Rubles.1Secondly, the minimum wage setting was decentralized with regions re-
ceiving the right to set their own regional minima above the federal floor. Some regions
made use of this opportunity instantaneously, whereby the minimum wage in these re-
gions increased by much more than the 109 % implied by the federal law. With over 80
regions being characterized by very diverse economic conditions —including employ-
ment and wages —and abrupt changes in its economic policy, Russia provides a very
good laboratory for studying the economic consequences of the minimum wage.
To estimate the impact of the 2007 increase in the minimum wage on employment,
we rely on the methodological approach proposed by Card (1992). It is based on com-
paring labor market outcomes before and after the minimum wage change across re-
gions with different fractions of affected workers (namely, workers earning between the
old and new minimum wages). This approach has found many applications in the em-
pirical literature, both in the USA (e.g., Card and Krueger 1995; Wessels 2007) and
internationally (e.g., Bazen and Skourias 1997 for France and Stewart 2002 for the UK).
The main strength of this paper is the use —for identification purposes —of the unique
data with extremely large variation in the minimum wage as well as labor market out-
comes across 85 regions of Russia. Our study is among the first to exploit this quasi-
experimental setting —and the 2007 reform in particular —in analyzing the labor marketMuravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 2 of 20

effects of the minimum wage.2Another strength of the paper is its focus on a broad
range of labor market outcomes, including not only employment and unemployment
rates among various sub-groups in the population but also informal employment. We
argue that data from post-transitional Russia —a country that combines essential fea-
tures of developed and developing economies —are particularly well suited for studying
the effect of the minimum wage on such multiple outcomes.
The main results of the paper can be summarized as follows. We find some evidence
of adverse effects of the minimum wage on employment. Specifically, the 2007
minimum wage hike was associated with a decrease in youth employment and
increased informality. The result is largely driven by regions that introduced their own
minimum wages above the federal floor. We attribute the latter to the larger magnitude
of the minimum wage hikes in these regions compared to those that simply adopted
the federal minimum wage. Another possibility is that the regional increases in the
minimum wage were less anticipated than the federal one, whereby it was impossible
for employers to adjust to them in advance. Importantly, the results are in line with the
findings in Muravyev and Oshchepkov (2013), which adopts the region panel data
approach (e.g., Neumark and Wascher 1992) to studying the effect of the minimum
wage on employment in Russia.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the institu-
tional background of the minimum wage setting in Russia. Section 3 outlines the meth-
odology of our empirical analysis. Section 4 describes the data, before Section 5
presents and discusses the empirical results. Finally, Section 6 concludes.
2 Institutional background
This section offers only a brief summary of the institutional background regarding the
minimum wage setting in Russia, given that the details can be found in previous stud-
ies, particularly Muravyev and Oshchepkov (2013) and Lukiyanova and Vishnevskaya
(2015). The minimum wage in Russia already existed during the central planning era,
in the form of the lowest monthly wage in the wage grid. However, the term minimum
wage was not used at that time. It only appeared in national law after the start of the
country ’s transition to a market economy.3Since the early 1990s, the minimum wage
has been defined as the minimum pay per month of full-time employment (typically
40 h per week). Until 2007, the minimum wage was determined at the federal
level. The federal minimum applied to all groups of workers without any
differences by age, occupation, or industry. It was set at the same level across re-
gions, with the exception of those in the N orth and Far East, where the so-called
Northern wage multipliers applied.4
In the mid-1980s, the ratio of the minimum to average wage (the Kaitz ratio)
amounted to about 35 –40 %, which is a typical level for OECD countries. In the
1990s —a period of economic reforms accompanied by hyperinflation —there was a dra-
matic erosion of the real minimum wage in Russia, despite regular minimum wage
hikes. As a result, by the start of the new century, the minimum wage amounted to a
mere 6 % of the average wage. A number of more substantial increases were introduced
between 2001 and 2007, although given the double-digit inflation in the country, they
only helped to keep the Kaitz ratio at about 10 % (Muravyev and Oshchepkov 2013).Muravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 3 of 20
----------------------------------------

[Page 4 of 20]
This changed in September 2007, when a comprehensive reform of the minimum
wage was introduced. First, the nominal minimum wage was raised by 109 %. Second,
the minimum wage setting was decentralized. Since September 2007, Russia ’s regions
have the right to define their own regional minima (which may be sector-specific)
above the federal threshold. Third, the 2007 reform of the minimum wage setting elimi-
nated the link between the minimum wage and the Northern multiplier, previously set
in federal law.
As a result of the reform, the nominal minimum wage more than doubled and the
Kaitz ratio exceeded 20 % nationwide. The “fraction affected ”—namely the share of
workers with wages above the old minimum wage but below the new minimum
wage —approached 6 %. Moreover, as many regions opted for own regional minima
above the federal threshold, considerable variation in the nominal minimum wage
across the regions emerged. Importantly, due to the very diverse levels of wages across
the country ’s regions, the cross-regional variation in terms of the Kaitz ratio was even
more dramatic. For example, Muravyev and Oshchepkov (2013) report the Kaitz index
range between 8 and 46 % in September 2007. Similarly, the fraction affected varied
from almost zero in rich regions to double-digit numbers in less developed ones. In
sum, the reform generated considerable variation in the nominal minimum wage as
well as in the Kaitz index and the fraction affected.
3 Methodology
In order to estimate the impact of the 2007 hike in the minimum wage on employment,
we rely on the methodological approach first proposed by David Card (1992). In his
study, Card analyzed the impact on teenage employment of the 1990 increase in the
minimum wage in the USA, from $3.35 to $3.80. The general idea behind his approach
may be summarized as follows: “A rise in the federal minimum wage will typically
affect a larger fraction of workers in some states than in others. This variation provides
a simple natural experiment for measuring the effect of legislated wage floors, with a
“treatment effect ”that varies across states depending on the fraction of workers initially
earning less than the new minimum ”(Card 1992, p. 22). Formally, the approach leads
to estimating the following equation in the cross section of regions or states:
ΔEmployment i¼αþβ/C3Fraction affected iþγ/C3Controls iþεi ð1Þ
where ΔEmployment iis the difference in average employment rates before and after
the hike in the minimum wage in region i; Fraction_affected iis the proportion of
workers who earn wages between the old and new minimum wages; Controls iis a list
of control variables; and ɛiis a conventional error term. A negative and statistically sig-
nificant coefficient on variable Fraction_affected iwould imply disemployment effects of
the minimum wage.5
Equation (1) is the baseline econometric model in our analysis. We estimate it by
OLS allowing for heteroscedastic standard errors (using the Huber/White/sandwich es-
timator of variance). In addition, we consider several extensions of Eq. (1) and estimate
the model using various sub-samples of the data.
First, we attempt to control for the heterogeneity across the regions, which has be-
come a primary focus in the empirical literature (e.g., Allegretto et al. 2013). With this
purpose, we include controls measuring the trend in the dependent variables before theMuravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 4 of 20

[Page 5 of 20]
reform (as in Card 1992), the change in industrial production over 1 year preceding the
reform, and the share of rural population in the regions.
Second, we distinguish between the federal and regional minimum wage hikes (see
Wessels 2007; Bazen and Le Gallo 2009). In particular, we conduct analyses separately
for the regions that simply adopted the new federal threshold for the minimum wage
(regions with the federal minimum) and those that opted for higher wage floors
(regions with own minima). We argue that these two groups differ not only in the mag-
nitude of the minimum wage hikes (the regional minima are by definition larger, and
often much larger, than the federal minimum) but also in employers ’ability to antici-
pate (and hence, adjust in advance to) the new wage floors. In particular, while the fed-
eral hikes were regular and more-or-less expected by employers throughout the 2000s,
the institution of the regional minimum wages was first introduced in the federal law N
54-FZ passed on April 20, 2007. Regional hikes in the minimum wage adopted between
April 2007 and the fall of 2007 are likely to have been much more unexpected among
employers than any of the federal hikes in the 2000s.
Third, we exclude regions where the Northern wage multipliers applied. This robust-
ness check is motivated by the fact that these regions have a particular structure of the
economy, with high shares of extracting industries, high wages, and low unemploy-
ment. More importantly, the increase in the federal minimum wage in 2007 was ac-
companied by eliminating the Northern wage multipliers (which were used to inflate
the old federal minimum), whereby the fraction affected in these regions is rather low
and contributes little to econometric identification.
Next, we check whether our key results are sensitive to introducing weights that cap-
ture different sizes of Russian regions in terms of population. The use of such weights
has been a common robustness check in many prior studies of the minimum wage at
the level of regions or industries (see Krueger 1995; Bazen and Skourias 1997; Baker et
al. 1999 as well as Wessels 2007). In our case, the main motivation comes from the fact
that Russia has a number of small regions with a very peculiar economic structure (e.g.,
economies centered on a particular industry), which often become outliers in empirical
analyses. In addition, the use of weights helps to estimate the effect of the minimum
wage on the economy at large.6
We also re-estimate the regressions using the dependent variable measured not as a
difference in employment rates but rather as a difference in their logs, similarly to
Wessels (2007). Finally, following Stewart (2002), we run a placebo test in which we
use the dependent variable lagged by 1 year (change in employment between November
2006 and November 2005) and the fraction affected by the 2007 reform.
4 Data
The data for this study come from several sources. The first source is the Labor Force
Survey (LFS) administered by the Russian Statistical Agency (Rosstat). The survey is a
repeated cross section conducted on a quarterly basis (in February, May, August, and
November). The data contain information on employment in each of Russia ’s regions,
including various demographic groups (in particular, the youth, women, and low-
educated workers).7The LFS covers all regions of Russia and contains several hundred
thousand observations. Importantly, the survey is representative at the regional level.
From the viewpoint of this paper, one of the main strengths of the Russian LFS is theMuravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 5 of 20

ability to differentiate between formal and informal employment.8One of its main
weaknesses is the absence of wage data, given that respondents are not asked questions
on wages to minimize survey non-response.
With these data at hand, we are able to compute the following dependent variables
measuring labor market outcomes in Russian regions on a quarterly basis:
/C15Employment rate (EMPLOY), defined as the number of employed people aged 15
to 72 divided by the total population aged 15 to 72.
/C15Formal employment rate (FORMAL), defined as the number of people (aged 15 to
72) employed in the formal sector divided by the total population aged 15 to 72.
/C15Informal employment rate (INFORM), defined as the ratio of the number of people
(aged 15 to 72) employed in the informal sector to the total population, for people
aged 15 to 72.
/C15Unemployment rate (UNEMPL), defined as the number of unemployed divided by
the economically active population, for people aged 15 to 72. As is standard in
labor market statistics, the economically active population comprises employed and
unemployed people.
/C15Youth employment rate (YOUT_E), same as the general employment rate but
computed for people aged 15 to 24.
/C15Youth unemployment rate (YOUT_U), same as the general unemployment rate but
computed for those aged 15 to 24.
/C15Female employment rate (FEM_E), defined as the number of employed women
aged 15 to 72 divided by the total number of women aged 15 to 72.
/C15Female unemployment (FEM_U), defined as the number of unemployed women aged

We supplement these data with information on regional minimum wages obtained
from databases of national and regional laws, such as Consultant Plus,10as well as web
sites of regional governments and other internet sources.
Next, we add data on the distribution of monthly wages across the Russian regions
prior to the 2007 minimum wage reform. These data are collected by Rosstat from a
detailed survey of employers conducted on an annual basis in April (henceforth, the
April survey of employers). To date, this is the only survey that provides detailed wage
data, particularly regarding the percentage of workers whose wages lie within a specific
bracket, for all regions of the country. We use the data from the 2007 wave of the sur-
vey, as the closest to the minimum wage hike in September 2007. With this informa-
tion at hand, we are able to compute the key independent variable in our regression
analysis, fraction affected . Note that due to the small number of brackets, we have to
resort to linear interpolation.11Muravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 6 of 20

The main strength of the April survey of employers is its large scale (over 90,000 or-
ganizations in all major industries and of all ownership types) and nationwide coverage.
However, there are also two important limitations: the survey excludes small businesses
yet includes wages of part-time workers. The former implies an underestimation of the
fraction affected (small firms —which are omitted from the survey —typically pay lower
wages compared to large firms) while the latter leads to an overestimation of the frac-
tion affected (a worker may have a monthly wage below the new minimum wage due
to engaging in part-time employment). We assess the importance of these limitations
for our estimation results using additional control variables that capture at the regional
level (a) the share of workers employed in small businesses in 2006 and (b) the share of
part-time workers in 2006. These additional data are taken from Rosstat.
Finally, we supplement all these data with information on the dynamics of output
(change in industrial production) and shares of urban vs. rural population, which are
also taken from the official publications by Rosstat.
The descriptive statistics of the data are shown in Table 1. The average fraction af-
fected amounts to almost 6.46 % for the federal increase in the minimum wage. Once
the regional hikes are taken into account, the respective number rises to 8.15 %. The
huge variation across the regions in the fraction affected is notable, ranging from 0.05
to 20.16 % for the federal hike and from 0.05 to 28.06 % for the regional ones. The data
also show considerable variation in labor market outcomes across regions; for example,

Notes: All variables except population are measured in percentages. Fraction affected is the percentage of workers who
earn wages between the old and new minimum wages, based on the distribution of wages in April 2007. Kaitz index is
the ratio of the minimum wage and the average wage in the region, measured in November 2007. Ind. production index
is the index of industrial production between the third quarter of 2006 and the third quarter of 2007. Share of workers in
small firms is computed as the share of workers employed by small businesses divided by the working-age population;
the data are from 2006. Labor market outcomes (variables EMPLOY-LOW_U) are measured in November 2007Muravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 7 of 20

the employment rate varies from 30 to 77 % (the average is 62 %) and the unemploy-
ment rate varies from 1 to 32 % (the average is 7 %).
As the constructed variable fraction a ffected has not been used in prior re-
search on the minimum wage in Russia, it may require additional validation. One
way of doing so is to compare it with another common measure of the signifi-
cance of the minimum wage, the Kaitz index. In contrast to the fraction affected
variable, the Kaitz index has been used in several papers on Russia, including
Kobzar (2009) and Muravyev and Oshchepkov (2013).12Figures 1 and 2 plot frac-
tion affected and Kaitz index against each other. Figure 1 represents the case of
the federal minimum, while Fig. 2 also accounts for the regional minima. The
two measures —fraction affected and Kaitz index —prove to be closely related
regardless of whether we consider the fede ral or regional level. The correlation
coefficients exceed 90 %, thus suggesting that the fraction affected variable indeed
captures regional variation that is useful in identifying the effect of the 2007
minimum wage hike.
It may be of interest to compare the pre-reform characteristics of the regions that in-
troduced their own regional minima with those that did not do so by the fourth quarter
of 2007. The results are shown in Table 2. In the regions that did not introduce own
minimum wages, the fraction affected is equal to 7.03 %. The regions that opted for
higher regional minimum wages saw a considerably higher fraction affected, at an aver-
age level of 12.63 %. Had they opted for the federal minimum wage instead, the fraction
affected was a mere 4.18 %. Thus, the regional hikes provide an important source of
variation in the data.
There are also sizable differences in labor market outcomes across the two
groups of regions. For example, the employment rate is 3.11 % higher in the re-
gions that opted for own minimum wages . Similarly, the unemployment rate is
3.02 % lower in these regions compared with those that followed the federal
minimum wage. The data suggest that own minima were introduced by the re-
gions that performed on average better than the others.13However, many of the
differences across the two groups of regions are statistically insignificant despite
possibly being economically large. This hi nts at the considerable heterogeneity
among the regions within each group.

[Page 9 of 20]
While interesting and informative, the above comparison between the two
groups of regions does not eliminate concerns about the potential endogeneity of
the regional minimum wages, which may lead to biased estimates. Lukiyanova
and Vishnevskaya (2015) provide some evide nce against the endogeneity concern,
suggesting that economic considerations were not the main driving force behind
the regional governments ’decisions to introduce regional minimum wages.
However, this evidence is by no means conclusive. Given our lack of reliable data
to address the endogeneity issue in a ri gorous way, we leave it for further
research.
5 Results and discussion
The main results of our empirical analysis are shown in Tables 3, 4, and 5. The tables
provide estimation results for the ten dependent variables chosen, namely employment
rate EMPLOY, formal employment rate FORMAL, informal employment rate IN-
FORM, general unemployment rate UNEMPL, youth employment rate YOUT_E, youth
unemployment rate YOUT_U, female employment rate FEM_E, female unemployment
rate FEM_U, employment rate among low-educated workers LOW_E, and unemploy-
ment rate among low-educated workers LOW_U. Table 3 contains the results for the
most parsimonious specification without any control variables. Table 4 shows the re-
gressions in which the only control variable is a lagged dependent variable (capturing
the trend in the dependent variable between November 2005 and November 2006).
Table 5 provides estimates for the regressions with additional controls, namely the
change in industrial production 1 year before the reform of the minimum wage as well
as the share of rural population. The results in Tables 3, 4, and 5 are arranged in the
following way: we start with the regressions for all the regions (panel A) then repeat
the analysis for the regions that simply adopted the federal minimum wage (panel B),
before focusing on the regions that introduced their own minima above the federal
floor (panel C). Subsequently, we drop the Northern regions from the sample (panel D)
and finally repeat the regressions for all the regions using their population as weights
(panel E). To save space, the tables only report the key coefficient of interest —on the
fraction affected variable.

We start with the results in Table 3. The regressions in panel A show statistically in-
significant results for all the regions. While most coefficients have signs consistent with
the presence of adverse effects of the minimum wage and some even have t-statistics
greater than one (in the regressions with informal employment rate and female
employment rate as the dependent variable ), none are statistically significant at

umns 2 and 3 —which is reported beneath the main estimation results in panel
A—suggests no differential effects of the minimum wage on formal and informal
employment ( pvalue = 0.22).
The results of estimating the model us ing the sub-sample of the regions that
simply followed the federal minimum wage (panel B) also show statistically insig-
nificant results, with all t-statistics being substantially smaller than one. As in the
above case, there is no statistically significant difference in the coefficients on the
fraction affected variable in the regressi ons with formal and informal employment
(pvalue = 0.89).
By contrast, panel C shows several statistically significant coefficients estimated on
the sub-sample of the regions that raised the minimum wage above the federal floor. In
particular, the results suggest that the minimum wage hike reduced the formal employ-
ment rate and increased informal employment, as well as reduced the youth employ-
ment rate and increased youth unemployment. The test for the same effect of the
minimum wage hike on formal and informal employment is rejected at the 5 % level
(pvalue = 0.011). Since the coefficient on the overall employment rate is statistically
insignificant, there is apparently a move of workers from the formal sector to theTable 2 Comparison of the pre-reform characteristics across the two groups of regions

informal one owing to the minimum wage hike. Furthermore, the coefficient on female
employment rate is negative and large in absolute value, although it fails to achieve
statistical significance at conventional levels. Note that the lack of significance may
stem from the paucity of the degrees of freedom, given that the regressions are esti-
mated on 17 observations only. Overall, these results are consistent with adverse effects
of the minimum wage hike on employment, including the substitution of informal for
formal employment.
When we estimate the regressions on the sub-sample that excludes the regions in the
North (panel D), we find two statistically significant coefficients. The hike in the
minimum wage appears to have reduced youth employment and increased youth un-
employment. The test for the difference in the key coefficient in columns 2 and 3 does
not reject the null ( pvalue = 0.74).Table 3 Regression results for the most parsimonious specification without control variables

Finally, panel E shows the results for the regression with weights. There are three sta-
tistically significant coefficients, in the regressions with formal employment, informal
employment, and youth employment. The signs of these coefficients are consistent with
adverse effects of the minimum wage on employment. There is also a statistically sig-
nificant difference in the coefficients on the fraction affected variable in the regressions
with formal and informal employment ( pvalue = 0.04).
Next, we switch to the results shown in Table 4. Similar to Table 3, we have no statis-
tically significant results in panel A of Table 4. The same holds for the results in panel
B. While some coefficients are large, they fail to achieve statistical significance. The test
for the difference in the key coefficient in columns 2 and 3 does not reject the null in
both panels.Table 5 Regression results for the specification with lagged dependent variable as well as change

Panel C shows several statistically significant coefficients. The minimum wage re-
duces the general employment rate, formal employment rate, and female employ-
ment rate. The coefficients on both youth employment rate and employment rate
among the low educated are negative and large in absolute value but statistically
insignificant. The coefficient on youth unemployment rate is positive and large but
fails to achieve statistical significance. Importantly, there is a statistically significant
difference in the main coefficient of interest in the models with formal and infor-
mal employment ( pvalue = 0.04).
Panel D shows the results from estimating the model on the sub-sample that ex-
cludes the regions in the North. There are only two coefficients that are economically
large, namely in the regressions with the youth unemployment and youth employment
rates. However, the latter is statistically insignificant. The null hypothesis on the equal-
ity of the coefficients in the models with formal and informal employment is not
rejected ( pvalue = 0.71).
In panel E, there are three statistically significant coefficients indicating a positive ef-
fect of the minimum wage hike on informal employment and a negative effect on the
youth employment rate and female employment rate. The key coefficient in the model
with formal employment as the dependent variable is negative and large, although it
fails to achieve statistical significance. The formal test rejects the null hypothesis on the
equality of the coefficients on the fraction affected variable in the regressions with for-
mal and informal employment at the 10 % level ( pvalue 0.07).
Table 5 shows the results of estimating the previous model (with a lagged dependent
variable) augmented with additional control variables, the change in industrial produc-
tion during the four quarters preceding the minimum wage reform, and the share of
rural population. The results are similar to those for the parsimonious model. A few
coefficients lose statistical significance while remaining economically large, especially in
panel C (the sub-sample of regions with own minimum wages). Apparently, the model
with two extra parameters cannot be estimated precisely based on 17 observations. The
test does not reject the null that the key coefficients in columns 2 and 3 of panel C are
the same ( pvalue = 0.11). By contrast, panel E contains statistically significant coeffi-
cients on five variables, including the informal employment and the youth employment
and unemployment rates as well as the female unemployment rate. Moreover, the test
for the equality of the coefficients in columns 2 and 3 rejects the null at the 10 % level
(pvalue = 0.06).
We conducted a number of additional checks (not reported in this article). First, we
ran a placebo regression in which we replaced the data from November 2007 and
November 2006 with data from November 2006 and November 2005, respectively.14
The fraction affected variable was taken from April 2007. As could be expected, this
placebo test returned statistically insignificant coefficients (aside from a couple of
wrongly signed ones). In addition, we re-ran the regressions using the difference in logs
of the dependent variables, as in Wessels (2007). The results proved qualitatively simi-
lar to those discussed above. Next, we dropped the data from the Republic of Dagestan,
a clear outlier in the Northeastern corner in Figs. 1 and 2, whereby the results
remained qualitatively the same as reported in the main analysis. We also checked
whether the results could be affected by the limitations of the wage data used in the
study. In particular, we included two additional control variables in the model,Muravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 15 of 20
----------------------------------------

[Page 16 of 20]
capturing (a) the share of workers employed in small businesses and (b) the share of
part-time workers in each region in 2006, both independently and jointly. The main
results remained unchanged. Interestingly, adding the share of part-time workers to the
list of regressors amplified the negative effect of the minimum wage on female employ-
ment. This is consistent with part-time employment being particularly common among
women.
Our summary and interpretation of these findings is the following. Firstly, there is
some evidence suggesting adverse employment effects of the 2007 hike in the minimum
wage in Russia. In particular, the hike reduced the employment rate among young
workers and promoted informalization of employment. Secondly, the result is particu-
larly strong for the sub-sample of regions that introduced their own minimum wages.
We believe that this pattern stems from the larger magnitude of the minimum wage
hikes in these regions compared to those that simply followed the federal minimum.
Another possibility is that the regional increases in the minimum wage were less
strongly anticipated than the federal one, whereby employers could not adjust to them
in advance. Indeed, the federal hikes were regular and were usually introduced after
prolonged discussions among employers, trade unions, and government. By contrast,
regional minimum wages only became possible after April 20, 2007, following the
changes in the federal law N 54-FZ. To be effective by the start of the fourth quarter of
2007, the regional minima had to be introduced within a few months, thus likely being
unexpected among employers.
We admit that the results obtained in this study may be regarded as not very strong
and robust, especially against the background of a very large increase in the minimum
wage. There are several potential explanations for the relative weakness of the results.
First, with a cross section of 85 observations, it is virtually impossible to properly
account for the heterogeneity in labor market outcomes and their dynamics across the
regions. Consequently, the standard errors become too large and the coefficients on the
minimum wage variables fail to achieve statistical significance. Indeed, when we at-
tempt to reduce this heterogeneity (e.g., by excluding the Northern regions from the
sample), the results become stronger. Second, the less-than-perfect quality of the data
at hand may play a role. In particular, in constructing the fraction affected variable, we
have to rely on wage data from the April survey of employers, which is biased towards
larger and registered firms and does not exclude wages of part-time workers. Moreover,
wages in this survey are reported in rather wide brackets, which forces us to resort to
interpolation. If there is a sizable measurement error in the constructed variable —which
is not unlikely —the regression coefficients will suffer from attenuation bias. In this case,
our results should be viewed as a lower bound of the actual effect of the minimum wage
on employment. Finally, the results can be at least partly explained by imperfect
enforcement of the minimum wage. Indeed, poor enforcement implies that the
minimum wage may have little or no impact on labor market outcomes. And there
is substantial evidence that enforcement/compliance is not perfect in developing
and transition countries.15
Nevertheless, our analysis retrieves many statistically significant coefficients that are
consistent with adverse effects of minimum wage hikes on employment. Importantly,
none of the statistically significant coefficients suggests the opposite. Overall, there is
sufficient evidence to claim that large hikes in the minimum wage adversely affectMuravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 16 of 20

employment —at least among certain groups of workers —as well as promote informali-
zation of the labor market in Russia.
6 Conclusions
In this paper, we extend the international literature on the minimum wage using new
data from Russia. Similar to many other studies focusing on transition and post-
transition countries (e.g., Muravyev 2008; Gorodnichenko et al. 2009; Eicher and
Schreiber 2010), we take advantage of a unique institutional setting with frequent and
abrupt regulatory changes to address an important question of general interest for labor
economists. Specifically, we look at the employment consequences of the sharp increase
of the minimum wage from 1100 to 2300 Rubles in September 2007.
We find some evidence of adverse effects of the minimum wage on the labor market.
In particular, the hike in the minimum wage upon which we focus is associated with
increased youth unemployment and informality. This finding is consistent with many
previous studies for both developed and developing economies (Neumark and Wascher
2008; Nataraj et al. 2014). Importantly, it is in line with the results in Muravyev and
Oshchepkov (2013), which are obtained using the region panel data approach with
Russian data.
Overall, our analysis supports the viewpoint that the minimum wage may be a prob-
lematic policy instrument —including in terms of tackling poverty and inequality —given
that it increases unemployment among the youth and forces workers to take informal
jobs, which are typically associated with lower job security, lower earnings, and a lack
of social security protection.
Endnotes
1This hike is almost unprecedented among not only developed but also developing
countries. We are aware of only two increases in the minimum wage similar in magni-
tude to the 2007 hike in Russia: one took place in Hungary in 2001 (Kertesi and Kollo
2003) and the other one occurred in Indonesia in the 1990s (Rama 2001). However, in
both cases, the doubling of the minimum wage did not happen immediately. In the
former case, it occurred in two steps within 1 year, while in the latter case, it took
4 years.
2There are only a handful of studies of the minimum wage policies in Russia. The list
includes Kobzar (2009), Lukiyanova (2011), Muravyev and Oshchepkov (2013),
Lukiyanova and Vishnevskaya (2015), and Kapelyuk (2015). However, none of these
focus on the employment effects of the 2007 hike in the minimum wage.
3This can be seen as an integral part of the process of building previously
missing labor market institutions during the transition from plan to market, see,
e.g., Muravyev (2014).
4In the state-controlled economy of the USSR, workers living in the North and Far
East were entitled by law to higher wages, introduced via the Northern multiplier,
which varied from 1.15 to 2 depending on the severity of living conditions in the re-
spective territories. The government thus tried to emulate compensating wage differen-
tials that would have emerged in a market environment. While the privatization
process of the 1990s rendered this system no longer applicable to the wage setting in
most of the economy, it remained binding for the minimum wage in both private andMuravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 17 of 20
----------------------------------------

[Page 18 of 20]
public sectors until August 2007. The Northern multiplier thus implied a substantial
cross-regional variation in the nominal minimum wage in Russia.
5Computing the elasticity of employment with respect to the minimum wage re-
quires, in addition to Eq. (1), a second equation that relates wage growth to the fraction
affected (see Card 1992). We do not follow this route due to the lack of necessary data
on wages.
6Russia ’s regions are very diverse in terms of size: while some of them have over five
million inhabitants, some others have fewer than 0.25 million people.
7These are not open-access data. Rosstat only provides free access to the averages of
some variables over four consecutive quarters. The detailed quarterly data were made
available to us through the Center for Labor Market Studies at the HSE Moscow. The
official link to the survey on the Rosstat web site: http://www.gks.ru/wps/wcm/connect/
rosstat_main/rosstat/ru/statistics/publications/catalog/doc_1140097038766 as accessed
on September 15, 2015.
8Rosstat considers all workers whose job is not within a firm as being informal. An
important advantage of such a general definition of informality is that it is not sensitive
to mistakes and non-responses of respondents when questions about the size of the
firm, its official status (registered vs. unregistered), contributions to the social security
funds, etc. are asked. However, this advantage can also prove to be a deficiency. In par-
ticular, it is possible that the definition omits some other important manifestations of
informal employment, especially informal employment within the formal sector.
Nonetheless, the available evidence from Rosstat suggests that such employment only
constitutes about 1 % of all informal employment. Therefore, we believe that the
measure of informal employment available to us is reasonably accurate and captures
the most essential aspects of this phenomenon in Russia.
9We contrast basic and general secondary education with professional and higher
education.

11For example, the survey reports the percent of workers within the following wage
brackets: below 1100 Rubles, from 1100 to 1800 Rubles, from 1800 to 2600 Rubles,
from 2600 to 3400 Rubles, and so on. If the minimum wage changed from 1100 to
2300 Rubles (which was the case in most regions), we add up the percent of workers
within the second bracket (1100 to 1800 Rubles) and (2300 −1800)/(2600 −1800) =
0.625 times the percent of workers in the third bracket in order to obtain a measure of
the fraction affected. It is not obvious whether one should incorporate the percent of
workers from the first bracket (below 1100 Rubles, the old minimum wage) into the
fraction affected variable. In particular, the respective numbers can be regarded as a
measure of non-compliance with the old minimum wage. If employers did not comply
with the old minimum wage, they are likely to ignore the new minimum. In any case,
including this bracket (corresponding to 1.2 % of workers nationwide) does not change
our results in any substantial way.
12Similar to the mentioned papers, we compute the Kaitz index using data on average
wages from the total survey of employers, which includes small firms and is run by
Rosstat on a monthly basis. In contrast to the April survey of employers, this monthly
survey does not provide detailed information on the distribution of wages and thus, it
is not suitable for computing the fraction affected, the key variable in our analysis.Muravyev and Oshchepkov IZA Journal of Labor & Development  (2016) 5:6 Page 18 of 20

[Page 19 of 20]
13Interestingly, these findings are consistent with the evidence from the USA suggest-
ing that own minimum wages (higher than the federal level) tend to be introduced by
stronger regions and in economically favorable periods (Neumark et al. 2014; Baskaya
and Rubinstein 2012).
14Note that there was a hike of the minimum wage on May 1, 2006, from 800 to
1100 Rubles (or 38 %). The timing of the minimum wage changes in the mid-2000 was
such that it is impossible to find four quarters without a minimum wage hike.
15However, several studies suggest a limited role of this factor in Russia. Kapelyuk
(2015) analyzes the non-compliance of employers with minimum wage laws by check-
ing the share of full-time workers with wages lower than the minimum wage in the
RLMS, the best panel survey of Russian households. He finds that “non-compliance
was modest, indicating that there was strong enforcement of the minimum wage
agreements ”(p. 403). Gimpelson et al. (2010), who study the enforcement of employ-
ment protection legislation in Russia, note that non-compliance with labor regulations
is higher in the Far East and the North of the country. However, these are high-wage
regions where the minimum wage bite is modest or even close zero.

ABSTRACT
We propose a novel method that infers the employment effect of a minimum wage increase by 
comparing  the number of excess jobs paying at or slightly above the new minimum wage to the 
missing jobs paying below it. To implement our approach, we estimate the effect of the minimum 
wage on the frequency distribution of hourly wages using 138 prominent state-level minimum 
wage changes between 1979  and 2016. We find that the overall number of low-wage jobs 
remained essentially unchanged over five years following the increase. At the same time, the 
direct effect of the minimum wage on average  earnings was amplified by modest wage spillovers 
at the bottom of the wage distribution. Our estimates  by detailed demographic groups show that 
the lack of job loss is not explained by labor-labor substitution  at the bottom of the wage 
distribution. We also find no evidence of disemployment when we consider higher levels of 
minimum wages. However, we do find some evidence of reduced employment in tradable  
sectors. In contrast to our bunching-based estimates, we show that some conventional studies can 
produce misleading inference due to spurious changes in employment higher up in the wage 
distribution.

1 Introduction
Minimum wage policies have featured prominently in recent policy debates in the United
States at the federal, state and local levels. California, Massachusetts, New York have passed
legislation to eventually increase minimum wages to $15/hour, while ﬁve other states are on
paths to raise their minimum wages of $12 or more. Over a dozen cities have also instituted
city-wide minimum wages during the past three years, typically by substantial amounts above
state and federal standards. Underlying much of the policy debate is the central question:
what is the overall eﬀect of minimum wages on low-wage jobs?
Even though nearly three decades have passed since the advent of “new minimum wage
research” (see e.g. Card and Krueger 1995; Neumark and Wascher 2008), there is scant
evidence on the eﬀect of the policy on overallemployment. This shortcoming is particularly
acute given the importance policymakers place on understanding overall responses. For
example, in its attempt to arrive at such an estimate, the 2014 Congressional Budget Oﬃce
(CBO) report noted the paucity of relevant research and then used estimates for teen minimum
wage elasticities to extrapolate the total impact on low-wage jobs.
In this paper we propose a novel method to identify the overall employment eﬀect of the
minimum wage together with its eﬀect on the shape of the frequency distribution of wages.
The basic idea behind our approach is summarized in Figure 1, which shows a hypothetical
frequency distribution of wages with and without a statutory minimum wage. The binding
minimum wage will directly aﬀect jobs that were previously paying below the new minimum
wage. These jobs may either be destroyed or shifted into compliance with the mandated
minimum. The jobs shifted into compliance create a “bunching” at and slightly above the
minimum. Crucially, the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution fades out
and becomes negligible beyond a certain point. Therefore, the overall employment and
wage eﬀects of the policy can be inferred from the localized employment changes around
the minimum wage. In particular, we derive the changes in employment from the diﬀerence
between the number of excess jobs at and slightly above the minimum wage and the number
of missing jobs below the minimum.
We apply this bunching approach to the U.S. context. The main empirical challenge is to
uncover the counterfactual wage distribution in absence of the minimum wage. Instead of
using either ad hocfunctional forms (Meyer and Wise 1983, Dickens, Machin and Manning
1998) or the distribution prior to the minimum wage increase (Harasztosi and Lindner 2016)
we exploit state-level variation in the minimum wage and compare states with and without
minimum wage changes using a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences strategy. In particular, we implement
an event study analysis that exploits 138 prominent state-level minimum wage increases

between 1979 and 2016. We estimate employment changes in each dollar wage bin relative
to the new minimum wage for three years prior to and ﬁve years following an event. Our
empirical approach, therefore, decomposes the aggregate employment eﬀect of the policy into
constituent wage bins, and we use these bin-by-bin estimates to calculate the missing jobs
below and excess jobs at and above the minimum wage.
There are several advantages of our bunching method relative to the more standard
approach that estimates the disemployment eﬀect using aggregate employment or wage
changes (e.g. Meer and West, 2016). First, the bunching approach focuses on employment
changes locally around wage levels where minimum wages are likely to play a role. When only
a small fraction of aggregate workforce is aﬀected by the minimum wage, such a localized
approach is crucial for uncovering meaningful “ﬁrst stage” wage eﬀects of the minimum
wage—something that is not possible with the standard approach except for subgroups like
teens. Second, by decomposing the aggregate employment impact by wage bins, we are able
to assess employment changes in the upper tail of the wage distribution. This can provide an
additional falsiﬁcation test, since large changes in the upper part of the wage distribution are
unlikely to reﬂect a causal eﬀect of the minimum wage. Third, the bunching approach gains
precision by ﬁltering out random shocks to jobs in the upper part of the wage distribution.
We use hourly wage data from the 1979-2016 Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate
the eﬀect of the minimum wage by wage bins. We ﬁnd that an average minimum wage hike
leads to a large and signiﬁcant decrease in the number of jobs below the new minimum wage
during the ﬁve years following implementation. At the same time, there is clear evidence
for the emergence of excess jobs at the minimum wage. However, as expected we ﬁnd no
indication for the employment changes in the upper part of the wage distribution, providing
further validation to the empirical design. We estimate that the number of excess jobs
closely matched the number of missing jobs: the employment for aﬀected workers rose by
a statistically insigniﬁcant 2.8% (s.e. 2.9%). Our estimates also allow us to calculate the
impact of the policy on the average wages of aﬀected workers, which rose by around 6.8% (s.e.
1.0%). The signiﬁcant increase in average wages of aﬀected workers implies an employment
elasticity with respect to own wage (or the labor demand elasticity in a competitive model)
of 0.41 (s.e. 0.43), which rules out elasticities more negative than -0.45 at the 95 percent
conﬁdence level.
An additional advantage of estimating the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the frequency
distribution of wages is that we can directly assess the extent which the direct wage eﬀects of
the minimum wage are ampliﬁed by wage spillovers. We ﬁnd that spillovers extend up to
$3 above the minimum wage and represent around 40% of the overall wage increase from
minimum wage changes. Interestingly, we also ﬁnd that the beneﬁts of wage spillovers are
2
----------------------------------------

[Page 5 of 116]
not equally shared: workers who had a job before the minimum wage increase (incumbents)
experience signiﬁcant wage spillovers, but we do not ﬁnd any evidence of such spillovers for
new entrants. This asymmetry suggests that spillovers may reﬂect relative pay concerns
within the ﬁrm (Dube, Giuliano and Leonard 2018) and the value of outside options or
reservation wages of non-employed workers unlikely to play a key role in generating wage
spillovers (e.g. Flinn 2006).
Our estimates are highly robust to a wide variety of approaches to controlling for time-
varying heterogeneity that has sometimes produced conﬂicting results in the existing literature
(e.g.,Allegretto, Dube, Reich and Zipperer 2017; Neumark and Wascher 1992). Moreover,
the shifts in the missing and excess jobs are strongly related to the timing of minimum wage
hike—providing further support that we uncover the causal eﬀect of the minimum wage.
Both missing jobs below the new minimum and excess jobs above were close to zero prior to
the minimum wage increase, which suggests that the treatment and the control states were
following a parallel trend. The drop in jobs below the minimum wage is immediate, as is the
emergence of the excess jobs at and slightly above. Over the ﬁve year post-treatment period,
the magnitude of the missing jobs below the new minimum wage decreases only slightly
underscoring the durability of the minimum wage changes studied here.
To go beyond our overall assessment of the 138 case studies used for identiﬁcation, we also
produce event-by-event estimates of the minimum wage changes. While we ﬁnd substantial
heterogeneity in the bite of the events, the distribution of employment eﬀects are consistent
with a null of no eﬀect anywhere. For example, our event-by-event analysis ﬁnds that the
estimated missing jobs rose in magnitude substantially with the minimum-to-median wage
(Kaitz) index. At the same time, the number of excess jobs also rose for these events to a
nearly identical extent. As a consequence, there is no relationship between the employment
estimate and the Kaitz index up to around 55 percent, conﬁrming that minimum wage
changes in the U.S. we study have yet to reach a level above which signiﬁcant disemployment
eﬀects emerge.
The lack of responses in overall employment might mask some heterogeneity in response
across types of workers. Our bunching approach can be easily applied to various sub-groups.
Moreover, the localized approach around the minimum wage allows us to estimate the eﬀect of
the policy for sub-groups where only a small fraction of workers are aﬀected by the minimum
wage. As a result, we can provide a more complete picture on how various groups respond to
the minimum wage.
We examine whether there is a shift from low-skill to high-skill workers at the bottom
of the wage distribution by partitioning workers into groups based on education and age.
Comparing the number of excess jobs at and above the new minimum wage and missing
3
----------------------------------------

[Page 6 of 116]
jobs below it across age-by-education groups shows no evidence that low-skilled workers
are replaced with high-skilled workers following a minimum wage increase. We also use
demographics to predict the probability of being exposed to the minimum wage increase, and
then assign workers to high, medium and low probability groups along the lines of Card and
Krueger(1995). While there is considerable variation in the bite of the policy, the employment
eﬀects in these sub-groups are mostly close to zero and not statistically signiﬁcant. The
similar responses across demographic groups also suggests that the beneﬁt of minimum wage
policies were shared broadly.
We are also able to provide a more comprehensive picture on responses across various
sectors of the economy. We show that the minimum wage is likely to have a negative eﬀect
on employment in tradable sector, and manufacturing in particular—with an employment
elasticity with respect to own-wage of around -1.4—although the estimates are imprecise. At
the same time, the eﬀect of the minimum wage is close to zero in the non-tradable sectors
(such as restaurants or retail), which employ most minimum wage workers in the U.S. today.
This evidence suggests that the industry composition of the local economy is likely to play
an important role in determining the disemployment eﬀect of the minimum wage (Harasztosi
and Lindner 2016).
This paper makes several key contributions to the existing literature on minimum wages.
First, our paper relates to the large and controversial literature on the employment eﬀects
of the minimum wages . The debate has often been concentrated on the impact on teen
employment (Card, 1992;Neumark and Wascher, 1992;Allegretto et al., 2017;Neumark
et al.,2014), workers in speciﬁc sectors (Card and Krueger, 1994;Dube et al., 2010;Katz
and Krueger, 1992;Lester,1964), or workers earning low wages prior to the minimum wage
increase (Abowd et al., 2000;Clemens and Wither, 2016;Currie and Fallick, 1996);, while the
evidence on the impact on overall employment is scant. A notable exception is Meer and West
(2016), who examine the relationship between aggregate employment at the state-level and
minimum wage changes. Diﬀerent from us, they ﬁnd a large negative employment estimate
using variants of the classic two-way ﬁxed eﬀects regression on log minimum wage. To
highlight the importance of disaggregating the aggregate employment eﬀects into wage bins,
we also calculate the bin-by-bin employment eﬀects in such a speciﬁcation. This exercise
produces a striking ﬁnding: the speciﬁcations that indicate a large negative eﬀect on aggregate
employment seem to be driven by an unrealistically large drop in the number of jobs at the
upper tail of the wage distribution, which is unlikely to be a causal eﬀect of the minimum
wage. We also provide an explanation for why the classic two-way ﬁxed eﬀect and our
event study approach produces diﬀerent results. We show that the large negative eﬀects on
employment is driven entirely by inclusion of the 1980s in the sample—a period with very
4
----------------------------------------

[Page 7 of 116]
few minimum wage changes. However, aggregate employment changes in the 1980s turn out
to be correlated with minimum wage changes in the 2000s. Therefore, while inclusion of the
1980 biases the estimation of state ﬁxed eﬀects in the two way ﬁxed eﬀect approach, it does
not aﬀect our event study approach that focuses on employment changes locally around the
event window.
Second, our paper contributes to the extensive literature on the eﬀect of the minimum
wage on overall wage inequality (Autor, Manning and Smith 2016; DiNardo, Fortin and
Lemieux 1996; Lee 1999). These papers examine shifts in the wage density and assume away
any possible disemployment eﬀect. The key novelty of our approach is that by focusing on
the frequency distribution instead of the density, we can assess the eﬀect on wage inequality
and employment at the same time.1Namely, we show that the measured wage spillovers are
not an artifact of disemployment, which would truncate the wage distribution; and we show
that they are unlikely to be an artifact of measurement error. Our spillover estimates are
similar to the ﬁndings of Autor, Manning and Smith (2016) and Brochu et al. (2017), and
more limited than those in Lee(1999).
Finally, our paper is also related to the growing literature that uses bunching to elicit
behavioral responses to public policies (Kleven 2016). Minimum wages discontinuously
increase the cost of hiring below the wage ﬂoor, while the extent of bunching provides prima
facieevidence of a causal eﬀect of the incentive in question. However, while the standard
bunching analysis estimates the counterfactual distribution from purely cross sectional
variation (Chetty et al., 2013;Saez,2010), here we follow the most recent literature (Best
and Kleven ,2013;Brown,2013) and use a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences strategy to construct the
counterfactual wage distribution.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2explains the bunching approach
and the empirical implementation, Section 3presents the main empirical ﬁndings on overall
employment eﬀects, wage spillovers and heterogenous responses to the minimum wage. Section
4demonstrates the importance of assessing employment changes far above the minimum
wage and highlights problems with the classic two-way ﬁxed eﬀects estimation. Section 5
concludes.
1In a recent working paper, Brochu et al. (2017) use the hazard rate for wages to estimate spillover eﬀects
in the presence of disemployment eﬀects.

2 Methodology and Data
2.1 The Bunching Framework
Our method identiﬁes the eﬀect of the minimum wage from the employment changes at
the bottom of the wage distribution. We illustrate our approach using Figure 1, which
summarizes the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution. The red line shows a
hypothetical (frequency) distribution of wages in the absence of the minimum wage. The
blue line depicts the actual wage distribution with a minimum wage at MW.
In the presence of a binding minimum wage, there should be no jobs below MW. In
practice, however, some jobs observed in the data will be sub-minimum wage because of
imperfect coverage, imperfect compliance, or measurement error. Therefore, the missing
jobs belowMW, given by/triangleb=Emp1[w<MW ]−Emp0[w<MW ], reﬂect the size of the
bite of the minimum wage.2HereEmp1[.]andEmp0[.]are the actual and counterfactual
frequency distributions of wages, respectively.
Not all missing jobs below the minimum wage are destroyed. Some or all of the jobs below
the minimum wage may be kept and their hourly pay raised to the minimum wage, creating
a spike atMW. Some jobs may be pushed slightly above the minimum wage in order to
maintain wage hierarchy within the ﬁrm, or because the minimum wage raises the bargaining
power of workers (e.g. Flinn,2011). Moreover, a minimum wage might induce low-wage
workers to participate in job search, some of whom may ﬁnd a job above the minimum wage.
However, the ripple eﬀects of the minimum wage are likely to fade out at certain point, which
we denote by Win Figure 1. In the neoclassical model there can be some positive employment
eﬀects in the upper tail of the wage distribution caused by labor-labor substitution. However,
the magnitude of these eﬀects are negligible in practice.3In models with labor market friction,
2When we refer to the “bite” of the minimum wage, or to the extent to which the minimum wage is
“binding,” we mean how eﬀective the minimum wage is in raising wages at the bottom. Therefore, the bite
is a function of (1) how many workers are earning below the new minimum wage, (2) how many of those
workers are legally covered by the policy, and (3) the extent of compliance.
3To see this, consider a three-factor version of the Hicks-Marshall law of derived demand with: low-skilled,
minimum wage labor ( L); higher skilled, non-minimum wage labor ( H); and capital. The eﬀect of a change
in low-skilled wage on higher skilled labor demand is given by the formula∂lnLH
∂lnwL=sL(σHL−η), where
sLis the share of minimum-wage labor in total production, σHLis the elasticity of substitution between
higher-skilled and low-skilled labor, and ηis the output demand elasticity. Since minimum wage workers’
share of the wage bill is around 3%, and labor’s share of output is roughly 2/3, this implies a low-skilled
share of production sL≈2%.Katz and Murphy (1992) estimates σHL≈1.4andηis often assumed to be 1
(Aaronson and French, 2007). This implies a cross-wage elasticity of∂lnLH
∂lnwL≈0.008. For a 10% increase in
the minimum wage in our sample, we estimate hourly wages of aﬀected workers increase by 7%. This implies a
minimum wage elasticity for higher-skilled employment of∂lnLH
∂lnMW=∂lnLH
∂lnwL×∂lnwL
∂lnMW≈0.008×0.7 = 0.0056.
Therefore, any plausible estimate of minimum wage impact on upper-tail employment should be very small.
We also empirically show the absence of an eﬀect on the upper tail of the distribution using our event-based
6
----------------------------------------

[Page 9 of 116]
wage spillovers also typically fade out, because workers and ﬁrms in the upper tail of the
wage distribution are operating in diﬀerent labor market segments (see Van den Berg and
Ridder 1998 andEngbom and Moser 2017 for examples of such models).
We assess the employment eﬀect of the minimum wage on low-wage workers by summing
the missing and excess jobs, /triangleb+/trianglea. Such an estimator is analogous to the “bunching”
method developed in the recent public ﬁnance literature, which uses bunching around points
that feature discontinuities in incentives to elicit behavioral responses (Kleven, 2016). The
minimum wage creates a discontinuity (a notch) by making it very costly to hire a worker
below a certain wage level, and the changes in the frequency distribution of wages identify
the behavioral responses to this policy. As is typical with the bunching approach, the spike
at the minimum wage and the elevated mass slightly above it provides prima facie evidence
of a causal eﬀect of the incentive in question. An additional feature of the estimator is that it
focuses on employment changes at the relevant part of the wage distribution: the sum of the
missing and excess jobs is in fact equal to the employment change below a wage threshold
W:/triangleb+/trianglea=Emp1/bracketleftBig
w<W/bracketrightBig
−Emp0/bracketleftBig
w<W/bracketrightBig
.
There are four key advantages of focusing on the bottom of the wage distribution. First,
the bunching approach proposed here identiﬁes the overall employment eﬀect using changes
locally around the new minimum wage—the part of the wage distribution where we expect
the policy to play a role. This variation is highly informative, yet rarely exploited. Second,
and more importantly, our localized approach allows us to estimate the eﬀects on overall
employment and on subgroups where the standard approaches often fail to provide meaningful
estimates on employment and wages. When only a small fraction of workers are directly
aﬀected by the minimum wage, the eﬀect on the average wage of such subgroups will be very
small. Without a clear wage eﬀect, it is not clear how to interpret the size of any employment
eﬀect found for those groups.4
Third, our approach locates the source of the employment eﬀects within the wage distri-
bution, and so one can use the upper tail employment changes as a falsiﬁcation test.5Since
large changes in jobs paying above $15 are unlikely to reﬂect the causal eﬀect of the minimum
design in section 3.
4In the Online Appendix Table A.1we demonstrate that the standard approach, which looks at the
wage and employment eﬀects aggregated over the entire wage distribution, fails to produce positive and
statistically signiﬁcant wage eﬀects in most cases. This indicates that the standard approach fails to capture
the program eﬀect of the minimum wage for these subgroups. At the same time, our bunching based estimates
always produce sizable and signiﬁcant wage eﬀects. The own-wage elasticity of employment estimated using
minimum wage variation is eﬀectively a Wald-IV estimate; hence the lack of a strong “ﬁrst stage” means
estimates are biased towards the OLS estimate obtained by naively regressing employment on wages (Bound,
Jaeger and Baker, 1995).
5This idea is similar to Autor et al. (2016) who use unrealistically large spillover eﬀects to validate the
empirical model in use.

[Page 10 of 116]
wage, reporting such employment changes in the upper tail can be highly informative about
model validity. Moreover, the potential bias from the confounding factors aﬀecting the upper
tail can be especially large when only a small fraction of the workforce is directly aﬀected
by the minimum wage (as is true in the U.S.). The contribution of these omitted variables
may be sizable compared to the relatively small expected eﬀect of the minimum wage on
aggregate employment. As a result, the bias arising from shocks to the upper tail can be
particularly severe when we are interested in estimating the overall employment eﬀect of
the minimum wage. Fourth, even if changes in the upper tail do not bias the estimates, the
bunching approach often improves the precision of estimates by ﬁltering out random shocks
to jobs in the upper part of the wage distribution.6
2.2 Empirical Implementation
The key empirical challenge in implementing the bunching approach is to estimate the
counterfactual wage frequency distribution in absence of a minimum wage increase. We
exploit state-level variation in minimum wage changes occurring between 1979 and 2016,
and identify the counterfactual distribution using an event study design. We use a similar
framework as Autor et al. (2006) and examine employment changes within an 8 year window
around 138 prominent state-level minimum wage events, where states increased their minimum
wage by at least $0.25, and where at least 2% of the workers were directly aﬀected by the
increase.7
Instead of estimating the eﬀect of these events on quarterly aggregate employment, we
disaggregate employment into $0.25 wage bins. Our basic regression speciﬁcation is the
following:
Esjt
Nst=4/summationdisplay
τ=−317/summationdisplay
k=−4ατkIτk
sjt+µsj+ρjt+Wsjt+usjt (1)
whereEsjtis the employment in $0.25 wage bin jin statesand at quarter t, whileNstis
the size of the population in state sand quarter t. The treatment dummy Iτk
sjtequals to

fall between kandk+ 1dollars of the new minimum wage. This deﬁnition implies that
τ= 0represents the ﬁrst year following the minimum wage increase (i.e., the quarter of
6Online Appendix Table A.2conﬁrms that the standard errors tend to be lower with the bunching approach
compared to an approach using aggregate employment.
7We exclude federal increases from our primary sample of events because for these events, the change
in missing number of jobs, Db, is identiﬁed only from time-series variation—as there are no “control states”
with a wage ﬂoor lower then the new minimum wage. However we show below that our employment and
wage estimates are similar when we include federal events as well.

[Page 11 of 116]
treatment and the subsequent three quarters), and τ=−1is the year (four quarters) prior
to treatment. Moreover, the Iτk
sjttreatment variables are not only a function of state and
time, but also of the wage bins. For instance, k= 0represents the four $0.25 bins between
MWandMW +$0.99andk=−1is a “below” bin with wages paying between MW−$0.01
andMW−$1.00. Our benchmark speciﬁcation also controls for state-by-wage bin and
period-by-wage bin eﬀects, µsjandρjt. This allows us to control for state-speciﬁc factors
in the earnings distribution and also the nation-wide evolution of wage inequality. Finally,
Wsjtinclude controls for small or federal increases.8We cluster our standard errors by state,
which is the level at which policy is assigned. Our standard errors, therefore, account for
the possibility that employment changes at diﬀerent parts of the wage distribution may be
correlated within a state.
The estimated ατkallow us to calculate the change in employment throughout the
wage distribution in response to the policy. The change in the number jobs (per capita)
paying below the new minimum wage between event date −1andτcan be calculated as:
/summationtext−1
k=−4ατk−/summationtext−1
k=−4α−1k. To be clear, this is a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimate, as it nets
outthechangeinthecounterfactualdistributionimplicitlydeﬁnedbytheregressionequation 1.
Analogously, the change in the number of jobs (per capita) paying between the minimum wage
andWis/summationtextW−MW
k=0ατk−/summationtextW−MW
k=0α−1k. For our baseline estimates, we set W=MW + 4.9
We deﬁne the excess jobs at or above the minimum wage as Daτ=/summationtext4
k=0ατk−/summationtext4
k=0α−1k
EPOP −1, and
the missing jobs below as Dbτ=/summationtext−1
k=−4ατk−/summationtext−1
k=−4α−1k
EPOP −1. By dividing the employment changes
byEPOP−1, the sample average employment-to-population ratio in treated states during
the year (four quarters) prior to treatment, we normalize the excess and missing jobs by the
pre-treatment total employment. The DaτandDbτvalues plot out the evolution of excess and
missing jobs over event time τ. We also report the excess and missing employment estimates
averaged over the ﬁve years following the minimum wage increase, Db=1

percentage change in the minimum wage averaged across our events, %DMW, we obtain the
8Our primary minimum wage events exclude very small increases. To ensure they do not confound our
main eﬀects, we include controls for these small events. We also separately control for federal minimum wages.
In particular, separately for small events and federal events, we construct a set of 6 variables by interacting
{BELOW,ABOVE }×{EARLY,PRE,POST }. HereBELOW andABOVE are dummies equal to 1 for
all wage bins that are within $4 below and above the new minimum, respectively; EARLY ,PREandPOST
are dummies that take on 1 if −3≤τ≤−2,τ=−1, or 0≤τ≤4, respectively. These two sets of 6 variables
are included as controls in the regression ( Wsjtin the equation 1).

employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage:
%DTotal Employment
%DMW=Da+Db
%DMW
We deﬁne the percentage change in aﬀected employment as the change in employment divided
by the (sample average) share of the workforce earning below the new minimum wage the
year before treatment, b−1:10
%DAﬀected Employment = %De=Da+Db
b−1
We also use the estimated coeﬃcients to compute the percentage change in the average
hourly wage for aﬀected workers. We calculate the average wage by taking the ratio of the
total wage bill collected by workers below the new minimum wage to the number of such
workers. Prior to treatment, it is equal to w−1=wb−1/b−1. Here the wage bill, wb−1, and the
number of workers earning below the new minimum wage just prior to the increase, b−1, are
averages for the full sample of events. The minimum wage increase causes both the wage bill
and employment to change. The new average wage in the post-treatment period is equal to
w=/parenleftBig
wb−1+Dwb/parenrightBig
//parenleftBig
b−1+De/parenrightBig
.11Therefore, the percentage change in the average wage of
aﬀected workers is given by:
%Dw=w
w−1−1 =wb−1+Dwb
b−1+De
wb−1
b−1−1 =%Dwb−%De
1 + %De(2)
The percentage change in the average wage is obtained by taking the diﬀerence in percentage
change in wage bill and employment, and dividing by the retained employment share. This
formula implicitly assumes the average wage change of those workers exiting or entering due
to the policy is the same as the wage of aﬀected workers those who remain employed.
10Notice that we divide by the actual share of the workforce and not by the change in it. As we pointed
out earlier, these two are not the same if there is imperfect compliance, imperfect coverage, or measurement
error in wages. While both divisions are meaningful, dividing by the actual share is the more policy relevant
elasticity. This is because policy makers can calculate the actual share of workers at the new minimum wage
and use the estimates presented in this paper. However, the change in the jobs below the new minimum wage
is only known after the minimum wage increase, and so it cannot be used for a prospective analysis of the
policy’s impact.
11The change in wage bill can be written as a function of our regression coeﬃcients as follows.
Averaging the coeﬃcients over the 5 year post-treatment window, αk=1

sample mean of [MW,MW + 1).

Finally, armed with the changes in employment and wages for aﬀected workers, we estimate
the employment elasticity with respect to own-wage (or the “labor demand elasticity” in a
competitive market):
%DAﬀected Employment
%DAﬀected Wage=1
%DwDa+Db
b−1
We calculate the standard errors around this elasticity using the delta method.
2.3 Data and sample construction
Weusetheindividual-levelNBERMergedOutgoingRotationGroupoftheCurrentPopulation
Survey for 1979-2016 (CPS) to calculate quarterly, state-level distributions of hourly wages.
For hourly workers, we use the reported hourly wage, and for other workers we deﬁne the
hourly wage to be their usual weekly earnings divided by usual weekly hours. We do not
use any observations with imputed wage data in order to minimize the role of measurement
error.12There are no reliable imputation data for January 1994 through August 1995, so
we exclude this entire period from our sample. Our available sample of employment counts
therefore spans 1979q1 through 1993q4 and 1995q4 through 2016q4.13
We deﬂate wages to 2016 dollars using the CPI-U-RS and for a given real hourly wage
assign its earner a $0.25 wage bin wrunning from $0.00 to $30.00.14For each of these 117
wage bins we collapse the data into quarterly, state-level employment counts Eswtusing the
person-level ORG sampling weights. We use estimates for state-level population aged 16 and
over,Nst, from the CPS-MORG (which in turn is based on the Census), as the denominator
for constructing per-capita counts. Our primary sample includes all wage earners and the
entire state population, but below we also explore the heterogeneity of our results using
diﬀerent subgroups, where the bite of the policy varies.

12The NBER CPS merged ORG data are available at http://www.nber.org/morg/ . Wage imputation
status markers in the CPS vary and are not comparable across time. In general we follow Hirsch and
Schumacher (2004) to deﬁne wage imputations. During 1979-1988 and September 1995-2016, we deﬁne wage
imputations as records with positive BLS allocation values for hourly wages (for hourly workers) and weekly
earnings or hours (for other workers). For 1989-1993, we deﬁne imputations as observations with missing
or zero “unedited” earnings but positive “edited” earnings (which we also do for hours worked and hourly
wages).
13In general, there has been an increase in the rate of imputation over time. However, in the Online
Appendix, we show that minimum wage raises are not systematically related to changes in the imputation
rate. Event study estimates for the eﬀect of minimum wages on the imputation rate show no substantial or
statistically signiﬁcant change 3 years before and 5 years after the treatment. (See Online Appendix Table
A.3and Online Appendix Figure A.2.)
14We assign all wages between $0 and $1 to a single bin and all wages above $30 to the $30 bin. The
resulting 117 wage bins are (0.00, 1.25), [1.25, 1.50),..., [29.75, 30.00), [30,∞).

error, which reduces the precision of our estimates. To address this issue, we benchmark the
CPS aggregate employment-to-population ratio to the implied employment-to-population
ratio from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which is a near universe
of quarterly employment (but lacks information on hourly wages). Online Appendix E explains
the QCEW benchmarking in detail. As we discuss below, the QCEW benchmarking has little
eﬀect on our point estimates, but substantially increases their statistical precision.
Our estimation of the change in jobs paying below and above a new minimum wage
requires us to specify minimum wage increasing events. For state-level minimum wage levels,
we use the quarterly maximum of the state-level daily minimum wage series described in
Vaghul and Zipperer (2016).15For the 138 minimum wage events, on average, 8.6% of workers
were below the new minimum wage in the year before these 138 events and the mean real
minimum wage increase was 10.1%.16
One concern when using $0.25 bins and CPS data is that some of the bins may be sparse
with very few or no workers. However, we stress that our employment estimate is based
on the sumof employment changes in 36 cells covering a $9 range [MW−$4,MW +$4],
summed over at least four quarters (typically twenty quarters). As a result, small or zero
employment in particular cells is not a major concern. In each state, there are, on average,
around 7 workers each quarter in each of the $0.25 bins between $5 and $15/hour in our
sample.17Since the coeﬃcients for our event dummies are estimated at a $1-bin-year-state
level, on average, for each of these we use around 112 individual-level observations per event.
Moreover, when we assess the total employment eﬀects, we calculate the sum of the $1-bin
estimates between $4 below and $4 above the minimum wage, and we consider 5 year averages.
This implies that, on average, we use approximately 5,040 individual worker observations
per event. This is a well-sized sample which allows a reliable estimate of the true counts of
employment for each event. Consistent with this point, we note that our approach is very
similar to a simpler method of estimating a regression using state-by-quarter data, where
the outcomes are the number of jobs or total wage bill under, say, $15/hour divided by
population. We show below that the resulting employment and wage estimates (and standard
errors) are very similar when using the simpler method.
Another potential concern with the data is that misreporting of wages in the CPS may
bias our estimates. If reported wages contain some measurement error, some workers earning

releases.
16All minimum wage increases including our events are shown in Online Appendix Figure A.1
17Overall, we have 847,314 wage bin-state-period observations, which we obtained from 4,694,104 individual
level observations, producing a count of 5.5 workers per $0.25 bin. However, the count per bin is higher in
the $5-to-$15/hour range because the upper tail wage bins are more sparse. The $5-to-$15/hour range is the
relevant one since it contains the [MW−$4,MW +$4]windows for all of our events.

[Page 15 of 116]
above the minimum wage will appear to earn below it, which could attenuate the estimate
forDb. However, this does not aﬀect the consistency of the estimate for Da+Dbas long as
the the minimum wage only aﬀects reported wages below W. The reason is straightforward.
Assume that 1% of the workforce mistakenly report earning below the new minimum wage
in the post-treatment period. This would lead our estimate of the missing jobs to be too
small in magnitude: ˆDb=Db+ 0.01. However, this misreporting would also lead to an equal
reduction in the number of excess jobs above, producing the estimate ˆDa=Da−0.01; this
will be true as long as these misreported workers are coming from the range [MW,W), which
is likely to be satisﬁed for a wide variety of classical and non-classical measurement error
processes where the support of the measurement error is contained in [MW−W,W−MW ].
Therefore, the employment estimate ˆDa+ˆDbis likely to be unaﬀected by measurement error
in reported wages. We also directly assess how misreporting of wages in the CPS may aﬀect
our results in Online Appendix D, where we compare the CPS hourly wage distribution to
micro-aggregated administrative data on hourly wages from three U.S. states that collect this
information. Reassuringly, the evolution of the number of jobs paying below the minimum
wage, and the number of jobs paying up to $5 above the minimum wage in the CPS data
from these three states match quite well with their counterparts using administrative data.18
3 Results
We begin our analysis by estimating the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the frequency
distribution of hourly wages. Figure 2shows the results from our baseline speciﬁcation (see
equation 1). We report employment changes averaged over the ﬁve year post-treatment
period,1
5/summationtext4
τ=0ατk, for each dollar wage bin ( k) relative to the minimum wage. Recall that all
employment changes are normalized to pre-treatment total employment in the state. Several
points should be noted.
First, there is a clear and signiﬁcant drop in the number of jobs below the new minimum
wage, amounting to 1.8% (s.e. 0.4%) of the total pre-treatment employment.19Almost3
4of
18InOnline Appendix E, we also structurally estimate a model of measurement error in reported wages
proposed by Autor, Manning and Smith (2016), and show that the contribution of misreporting error to the
overall variance in wages in the CPS and in administrative data on hourly wages from three U.S. states are
very similar. Furthermore, we semi-parametrically deconvolve the CPS wage distribution using the estimated
measurement error model and show that the bunching estimates using this measurement error corrected
distribution are very similar to the baseline estimates.
19The discrepancy between the actual number of jobs below the new minimum, which is 8.6% of total pre
treatment employment on average, and the change in the number of jobs below it, which is 1.8% on average,
can be explained by the following factors. First, some of the jobs below the minimum wage (e.g. tipped
workers) are exempted from the minimum wage in most states. Second, there are often multiple changes in
the minimum wage in a relatively short period. In these cases, the cumulative eﬀect of the various treatments
13
----------------------------------------

[Page 16 of 116]
this reduction occurs in the $1 wage bin just under the new minimum. Second, there is also
a clear and signiﬁcant increase in jobs just at the new minimum wage (at the $0 wage bin).
Third, there is also a statistically signiﬁcant increase in employment in the wage bin $3 above
the new minimum and modest, statistically insigniﬁcant increases in the $1 and $2 bins. This
pattern of employment changes is consistent with limited wage spillovers resulting from the
minimum wage increase, as suggested in Autor, Manning and Smith (2016).20Fourth, the
excess jobs between the new minimum and $4 above it represents 2.1% (s.e. 0.3%) of the
total pre-treatment employment. Finally, the employment changes in the upper tail wage
bins, from $5 above the minimum wage to $17 or more (the ﬁnal bin), are all small in size
and statistically insigniﬁcant—both individually as well as cumulatively as shown by the red
line, which represents the running sum of employment changes.
The bunching estimate for employment change adds the missing jobs below and excess
jobs above the minimum wage: /trianglea+/triangleb. We divide this change by the jobs below the new
minimum wage ( b−1= 8.6%) to obtain a change in the aﬀected employment of 2.8% (s.e.
2.9%), which is positive but statistically insigniﬁcant. We can also divide the employment
change Da+Dbby the sample-averaged minimum wage increase of 10.1% to calculate the
employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage of 0.024 (s.e. 0.025). This estimate
is statistically insigniﬁcant, and the 95% conﬁdence interval rules out substantial reductions
in the aggregate employment, including the baseline aggregate employment elasticity of -0.074
inMeer and West (2016) (see their Table 4). The most common minimum wage employment
elasticities are from teens; for example, Neumark and Wascher (2008) argue this falls between
-0.1 and -0.3, while Allegretto et al. (2017) argue that it is closer to zero. However, the directly
aﬀected share of teens (43.2%) is much larger than the workforce overall (8.6%). Therefore,
to make our estimates on overall employment comparable to the estimates for teens we can
multiply our estimate and standard errors by the ratio of the shares 0.432/0.086=5.02. This
leads to an aﬀected-share-adjusted 95% conﬁdence interval of [-0.13, 0.37], which rules out
most of the -0.1 to -0.3 range.
Second, using the formula in equation 2we can also calculate the change in the average
wage and the employment elasticity with respect to own wage (i.e., the labor demand elasticity
in the competitive model). We estimate that the eﬀect of the minimum wage on average
wages is 6.8% (s.e. 1.0%), which is statistically signiﬁcant. The estimate for the elasticity of
employment with respect to own wage is 0.411 (s.e. 0.430). The conﬁdence intervals rule out
should be considered: when we adjust for this we ﬁnd the change in the number of jobs below the minimum
rises in magnitude from 1.8% to 2.5%. Third, there is some wage growth even in the absence of a minimum
wage increase, and our event study design controls for these changes.
20The $3 above the minimum wage is around the 23rdpercentile of the wage distribution on average. Autor,
Manning and Smith (2016) ﬁnds the wage spillovers are eﬀectively zero at around the 25thpercentile.

[Page 17 of 116]
any own-wage elasticities more negative than -0.450 at the 95 percent conﬁdence level. Such
a lower bound rules out many estimates in the literature that found negative employment
elasticity (see Online Appendix Figure A.6; also, Neumark and Wascher (2008) argue that
the own-wage employment elasticity can easily be -1 or even -2). .
Figure3shows the changes in the missing jobs paying below the new minimum wage
(Dbτ), and the excess jobs paying up to $4 above the minimum wage (Daτ) over annualized
event time using our baseline speciﬁcation. All the estimates are expressed as changes from
event dateτ=−1, or the year just prior to treatment, the estimates for which are normalized
to zero. There are four important ﬁndings that we would like to highlight. First, we ﬁnd a
very clear reduction in the jobs paying below the new minimum wage (shown in red) between
the year just prior to treatment ( τ=−1)and the year of treatment (τ= 0)—this shows
that the minimum wage increases under study are measurably binding. Second, while there
is some reduction in the magnitude of the missing jobs in the post-treatment window, it
continues to be very substantial and statistically signiﬁcant ﬁve years out, showing that
the treatments are fairly durable over the medium run. Third, the response of the excess
jobs at or above the new minimum ( Da) exhibits a very similar pattern in magnitudes, with
the opposite sign. There is an unmistakable jump in excess employment at τ= 0, and a
substantial portion of it persists and is statistically signiﬁcant even ﬁve years out. Fourth,
for both the changes in the excess and missing jobs there is only a slight indication of a
pre-existing trend prior to treatment. The τ=−2leads are statistically indistinguishable
from zero and although there is some evidence of changes three years prior to treatment, the
leading eﬀects are very small relative to the post-treatment eﬀect estimates. Moreover, the
slight downward trend in excess jobs, and the slight upward trend in missing jobs is consistent
with falling value of the real minimum wage prior to treatment. The sharp upward jump in
both the excess and missing jobs at τ= 0, the lack of substantial pre-treatment trends, and
the persistent post-treatment gap between the two shares all provide strong validation of
the research design. Online Appendix Figure A.4shows analogous time paths for wages and
employment showing sharp and persistent wage eﬀect at τ= 0coupled with little change in
employment over the event window–either before or after treatment.
RobustnessChecks. InTable 1, weassesstherobustnessofthemainresultstoincluding
additional controls for time-varying, unobserved heterogeneity. This is particularly important
since results in the existing literature are often sensitive to the inclusion of various versions of
time varying heterogeneity (e.g., Neumark, Salas and Wascher 2014 andAllegretto et al. 2017).
In Column (1) we report the ﬁve-year-averaged post-treatment estimates for the baseline
speciﬁcation shown in Figures 2and3. Columns (2) and (3) add wage-bin-by-state speciﬁc
linear and quadratic time trends, respectively. Note that in the presence of 3 pre-treatment
15
----------------------------------------

[Page 18 of 116]
and 5 post-treatment dummies, the trends are estimated using variation outside of the 8 year
window around the treatment, and thereby unlikely aﬀected by either lagged or anticipation
eﬀects. Columns (4)-(6) additionally allow the wage-bin-period eﬀects to vary by the 9
Census divisions. Column (6) represents a highly saturated model allowing for state-speciﬁc
quadratic time trends and division-period eﬀects for each $0.25 wage bin.
Overall, the estimates from the additional speciﬁcations are fairly similar to the baseline
estimate. In all cases, there is a clear bite of the policy as measured by the reduction in jobs
paying below the minimum, Db. Consistent with the presence of a substantial bite, there is
statistically signiﬁcant increase in real wages of aﬀected workers in all speciﬁcations: these
range between 5.7% and 6.9% with common wage-bin-period eﬀects (columns 1, 2, 3, ), and
between 4.3% and 5.0% with division-speciﬁc wage-bin-period eﬀects (columns 4, 5 and 6).
In contrast, the proportionate change in employment for aﬀected workers is never statistically
signiﬁcant, and is numerically smaller than the wage change, ranging between -1.9% and 3.6%
across the 8 speciﬁcations. For most part, the employment estimates are small or positive;
the only exception is column (5) with state-speciﬁc linear trends and bin-division-speciﬁc
period eﬀects. The employment elasticities with respect to wage are -0.449 (s.e. 0.574) .
However, adding quadratic trends to the former speciﬁcation (column 6) substantially reduces
the magnitude of the employment elasticity with respect to the wage to -0.003 (s.e. 0.455).
Finally, column (7) provides employment and wage estimates using state-by-period panel,
where we regress either wage bill or employment per capita under an absolute wage threshold
(W), and then estimate the change in aﬀected wage and employment using the same formulae
as our baseline.21The estimates and standard errors for aﬀected employment (0.025, se 0.029)
and wage (0.063, se 0.011) are virtually identical to column 1, clarifying that use of wage bins
or choices around those have no impact on our key estimates. At the same time, unlike our
baseline speciﬁcation, this simpler method using an absolute wage threshold cannot provide
separate estimates for excess and missing jobs.
We also show in Online Appendix A that our results are robust to focusing only on
the events occurring in the states that do not allow tip credits; dropping occupations that
allows tipping; using full-time equivalent job counts; restrict the sample to hourly workers;
additionally using federal-level minimum wage changes for identiﬁcation; using the raw CPS
data instead of the QCEW benchmarked CPS; without using population weights; and focusing
on the post-1992 period.
21The threshold is W= 15, which is at least $4 above the new minimum wage in all of our events but one.

3.1 Heterogenous Responses to the Minimum Wage
Our bunching approach can also be applied to estimate the eﬀect of the minimum wage on
speciﬁc subgroups.
By demographic groups. We assess the presence of labor-labor substitution at the
bottom of the wage distribution by examining employment responses across various demo-
graphic groups.22In Table 2we report estimates for workers without a high school degree,
those with high school or less schooling, women, black or Hispanic individuals, and teens
using our baseline speciﬁcation (see equation 1).
As expected, restricting the sample by education and age produces a larger bite. For
example, for those without a high school degree, the missing jobs estimate, Db, is -6.5% while
for those with high school or less schooling it is -3.2%. These estimates for the missing jobs
are, respectively, 261% and 78% larger than the baseline estimate for the overall population
(-1.8%, from column 1 in Table 1). Nevertheless, the large variation in the missing jobs
across various demographic groups matched closely by excess jobs above the new minimum
wage.23In all cases, except for the black or Hispanic group, the excess jobs are larger than
the missing jobs indicating a positive albeit statistically insigniﬁcant employment eﬀect. For
black or Hispanic individuals, the diﬀerence between excess and missing jobs is negligible.
As a result, the employment elasticities with respect to own wage range between -0.086 and
0.570 for the ﬁrst ﬁve demographic groups of the table. In all cases but one, the elasticities
are statistically indistinguishable from zero. The sole exception is those without a high school
degree, for whom the employment elasticity with respect to the wage is 0.475 (s.e. 0.268)
and is marginally signiﬁcant at the ten percent level. The minimum wage elasticity for teens
is 0.125, which is more positive than some of the estimates in the literature, though we note
that it is not statistically signiﬁcant given a standard error of 0.134.24
In addition, we examine the eﬀects on groups of workers with diﬀerential probability of
being exposed to the minimum wage changes. To determine the likelihood of exposure, we
22Existing evidence on labor-labor substitution has typically focused on speciﬁc groups like teens (Giuliano,
2013), individual case studies (Fairris and Bujanda, 2008), or speciﬁc segments like online labor platforms
(Horton, 2018).
23InOnline Appendix A we also show that the close match between excess jobs and missing jobs holds also
if we fully partition the workforce into 23 age-education cells.
24It should be noted that the teen estimates are unrelated to the use of bunching method, since the beneﬁts
of focusing on employment changes around the minimum wage is small for groups where most workers are
low wage ones. In Online Appendix Table A.10we show that our event study estimates are close to zero for
teens even if we use overallteen employment. At the same time, the classic two-way ﬁxed eﬀect speciﬁcation
with log minimum wage (TWFE-logMW) generates a sizable negative estimate for teens and for overall
employment as well. In Section 4 we discuss this discrepancy and argue that the diﬀerence between our
approach and TWFE-logMW are driven by how the two empirical model aﬀected by employment changes
occurring many years before the minimum wage hike.

[Page 20 of 116]
construct a prediction model analogous to Card and Krueger (1995). We use observations
from three years prior to the 138 events that also lie outside any of the 5-year post-treatment
windows and we estimate a linear probability model of having a wage less than 125% of the
statutory minimum wage on a rich set of demographic predictors.25We use the estimated
model to obtain predicted probabilities of being exposed to minimum wage increases for
all individuals in the sample regardless of their actual employment status. We then use
the predicted probabilities to place individuals in three groups: a “high probability” group
that contains individuals in the top 10 percent of the predicted probability distribution; a
“low probability” group that contains workers in the bottom 50 percent of the predicted
probabilities; and a middle group containing the rest.
As expected, the high probability group shows a considerably larger bite ( Db=−9.4%)
than the middle group ( Db=−2.0%), and the low probability group ( Db=−0.4%). At the
same time the employment elasticities are very similar across the three Card and Krueger
probability groups. It is worth mentioning that the most precise estimate for the parameter
in this paper appears in column (6) of Table 2, where we look only locally around the
minimum wage and also focus on the high probability group: the conﬁdence interval rejects
any value smaller than -0.251 and larger than 0.663. Such a conﬁdence interval is quite narrow
and rejects many estimates in the literature—highlighting the gains from combining the
demographic proﬁling approach of Card and Krueger with the bunching approach advanced
in this paper. The employment elasticities for the other groups are similar in magnitude,
though less precise.26
Overall, these ﬁndings provide little evidence of heterogeneity in the employment eﬀect
by skill level; the lack of a reduction in overall low-wage jobs does not appear to mask a shift
in employment from low-skill to high-skill workers.
By industrial sectors. Much of the literature has focused on speciﬁc sectors like
restaurants where the minimum wage is particularly binding—therefore making it easier
to detect a clear eﬀect on the sectoral wage. In contrast, by focusing on changes at the
bottom of the distribution, our approach can recover employment and wage responses even
25We use the exact same predictors as in Card and Krueger (1995): all three-way interactions of non-white,
gender, and teen indicators; all three-way interactions of non-white, gender, and age 20-25 indicators; less than
high school dummy variable; continuous highest grade completed variable; up to third order polynomial in
labor-market experience ; Hispanic ethnicity indicator; interactions of the education and experience variables
with gender. Cengiz(2018) shows the predictions using this Card and Krueger model compare favorably with
those from more sophisticated machine learning based methods.
26InOnline Appendix A we show that if we estimate the impact of the events on the aggregate wage and
employment outcomes for each of the three probability groups, we can obtain a clear wage eﬀect only for the
high probability group—capturing only around 36% of all minimum wage workers. This highlights the value
of focusing at the bottom of the wage distribution which allows us to get an overall estimate for all low wage
workers.

[Page 21 of 116]
in industries where only a small fraction of workers are directly aﬀected by the minimum
wage increase. This allows us to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the eﬀect of
the policy across a range of industries.
In Table 3 we report estimates for various sectors in the economy. We assign workers to
tradable and non-tradable sectors following Mian and Suﬁ (2014).27The table shows that the
bite of the minimum wage varies a lot across industries. The minimum wage is highly binding
in the restaurant sector with a missing jobs estimate of 10.1%, while it does not appear to be
binding in the construction sector. The minimum wage is more binding in the non-tradable
sector (6.6%) than in the tradable sector (1.6%) or in the manufacturing sector (1.7%).
The eﬀect of the minimum wage on employment also varies by sector. We ﬁnd that
the number of excess jobs at and above the minimum wage is smaller than the missing
jobs in the tradable sector, and so the employment eﬀect is negative (-11.1%, s.e. 13.6%),
albeit not statistically signiﬁcant. Similarly, the point estimate in the manufacturing sector
suggests that around 10.1% (s.e. 14.5%) of the jobs directly aﬀected by the minimum wage
are destroyed. The implied employment elasticity with respect to own wage is quite large in
magnitude in both sectors (-1.910 in the tradable and -1.385 in manufacturing), although the
estimates are imprecise and statistically insigniﬁcant.
At the same time, we ﬁnd no indication for negative disemployment eﬀects in the non-
tradable, restaurant, and retail sectors where most minimum wage workers are employed in
the U.S. The employment elasticity with respect to own wage in the non-tradable sector is
positive (0.387, s.e. 0.597), which is in stark contrast to the tradable sector, where we ﬁnd
a large negative elasticity. Harasztosi and Lindner (2016) ﬁnd similar sectoral patterns in
Hungary and argue, using revenue data, that the larger job losses for tradable reﬂect a more
elastic consumer demand in that sector.
By pre-treatment employment status. We consider the eﬀect of the minimum wage
separately on workers who were employed prior to the minimum wage increase (incumbent
workers) and for new entrants into the labor market. We partition our sample of wage earners
into incumbent workers and new entrants by exploiting the fact that the CPS interviews each
respondent twice, exactly one year apart.28The partition limits our sample to the 1980-2016
27Mian and Suﬁ (2014) deﬁne “tradable” industries as having either the sum of imports and exports
exceeding $10,000 per worker or $500 million total; their “non-tradable” sector consists of a subset of
restaurant and retail industries; “construction” consists of construction, real estate or land development-
related industries. We use the list in Mian and Suﬁ (2014) of 4-digit NAICS industries and Census industry
crosswalks to categorize all the industries in the CPS for 1992-2016. In our sample the shares of employment
are 13%, 14%, 10%, for tradable, non-tradable, construction, respectively. See more details in Online Appendix
D. Since consistent industrial classiﬁcations limit our sample to the 1992-2016 period, we ﬁrst replicate our
benchmark analysis using all industries for this restricted sample in column (1) in Table 3. The estimated
employment and wage eﬀects on this restricted sample are similar to the full 1979-2016 sample.
28All CPS respondents are interviewed for four months in the ﬁrst interview period, then rotated out of

time period covering 137 eligible minimum wage-raising events and also restricts our time
window to one year around the minimum wage increase rather than the ﬁve years in our
baseline sample.
Figure4shows the event study estimates for new entrants (panel a) and incumbents
(panel b) for each k-dollar wage bin relative to the new minimum wage. For both subgroups,
new minimum wages clearly bind, with signiﬁcantly fewer jobs just below and signiﬁcant
more at the new minimum. This highlight that studies that restricts its sample to incumbent
workers (e.g. Abowd et al. 2000; Currie and Fallick 1996; Clemens and Wither 2016) can
only provide a partial characterization of the full eﬀects of the minimum wage increase, since
new entrants are also aﬀected by the policy.
For both groups the excess jobs closely match the missing jobs (for incumbents Da= 1.3%
andDb=−1.2%and for new entrants Da= 0.6%andDb=−0.5%) and so the net
employment changes are approximately zero. The green and blue solid lines show the running
sums of employment changes up to the corresponding wage bin for each group. The lines show
that in both cases there is little change in upper tail employment. We note that if employers
are replacing lower skilled workers with higher skilled ones, we should expect to see some
reduction in jobs for previously employed workers, perhaps oﬀset by high skilled entrants;
the lack of job loss for incumbents provides additional evidence against such labor-labor
substitution. The aﬀected wage increase for incumbents (9.5%, s.e. 2.0%) is signiﬁcantly
larger than it is for new entrants (1.9%, s.e. 1.3% ) and some of these diﬀerences can be
explained by the lack of spillover eﬀects for the new entrants. In the next section we return
to this issue.
3.2 Wage spillovers
So far we have focused on the employment eﬀects of the minimum wage. However, an equally
important question is understanding the nature of the wage eﬀects. In this section, we
quantify the direct eﬀect of the minimum wage and the indirect eﬀect that comes from wage
spillovers.
We calculate the direct (or “no spillover”) wage increase by moving each missing job
under the new minimum wage exactly to the new minimum wage:

the survey for eight months, and then rotated back into the survey for a ﬁnal four months of interviews. In
the fourth month of each interview period (the “outgoing rotation group”), respondents are asked questions
about wages. Appendix Online Appendix D explains how we match workers across rotation groups.
20
----------------------------------------

The total wage increase of aﬀected workers, %Dw, in equation 2incorporates both this direct
eﬀect as well as the add-on eﬀect from wage spillovers. Therefore, the diﬀerence between the
two measures, %Dw−%Dwno spillover , provides an estimate of the size of the wage spillovers.
Note that our spillover estimates use the frequency distribution of wages, which contrasts
with the earlier literature relying on the density of wages (see e.g. Card and Krueger 1995;
DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux 1996; Lee 1999; Autor, Manning and Smith 2016). As a result,
changes in employment—which could create an artiﬁcial spillover eﬀect when using the wage
density—do not aﬀect our estimates.
We report our estimates of wage spillovers in Table 4, where the columns show estimates
of the total wage eﬀect %Dw,the “no spillover” wage eﬀect %Dwno spillover , and the spillover
share of the total wage increase calculated as%Dw−%Dwno spillover
%Dw. The ﬁrst row shows the
estimated eﬀects for the entire workforce. Column (1) repeats the estimated total wage eﬀect
from Column (1) in Table 1, which is 6.8% (s.e. 1.0%). Column (2) shows that in the absence
of spillovers, wages would increase by 4.1% (s.e. 0.9%). Column (3) shows that 39.7% (s.e.
11.9%) of the total wage eﬀect is caused by the ripple eﬀect of the minimum wage.
In Table 4we also report estimates for several subgroups. The share of spillovers in the
total wage increase is relatively similar for several key demographic groups, such as those
without a high school degree (37.0%), teens (34.7%), those without a college degree (40.2%),
and women (35.9%). In most cases, the spillover share is statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
from zero at the 5 percent level. One exception is Black or Hispanic individuals, for whom
the estimated share of wage spillover is much smaller at 17.9% (s.e. 26.5%), which is less
than half of the 39.7% (s.e. 11.9%) spillover share for all workers. Although the diﬀerence
is not statistically signiﬁcant, this ﬁnding nonetheless suggests that the wage gains at the
bottom may be more muted for some disadvantaged groups.29
We also ﬁnd a substantially smaller change in wages due to spillovers in the tradable
sector, though the estimates here are a bit imprecise. This highlights that wage aﬀects are
small in the tradable sector and some of it might be possibly undone by clawbacks from
higher wage workers. The combination of this evidence and the disemployment eﬀects suggest
that there may be more unintended consequences of minimum wages when the tradable sector
constitutes a more sizable share of the aﬀected workforce.
We also ﬁnd a stark diﬀerence in the spillover shares of wage increases for incumbents
versus new entrants. Incumbents receive a larger total wage increase (9.5%) than the overall
workforce (6.8%), but the spillover share for incumbents and all workers is relatively similar
(42.2% and 39.7%, respectively). In contrast, the spillover share for entrants is -17.8%,
29The smaller spillover for Black/Hispanic workers is not due to sectoral or incumbency composition, which
are very similar to other workers (results not reported).
21

[Page 24 of 116]
suggesting that essentially all of the wage increase received by new entrants is through the
creation of jobs at or very close to the new minimum. Larger spillovers for incumbents relative
to entrants can also be seen in Figure 4. Two points should be noted.
First, the stark diﬀerences in the size and scope of spillovers for the incumbent and for
the new entrants are inconsistent with a simple measurement error process common to both
groups. This suggest that spillover eﬀects found are likely to reﬂect real responses and not
measurement error in CPS-based wages, a possibility that is raised by Autor, Manning and
Smith(2016).30
Second, since we ﬁnd that essentially none of the wage spillovers accrue to workers who
were not employed prior to the minimum wage increase, it is unlikely that our estimates
of spillovers primarily reﬂect an increase in the value of the outside options or reservation
wages of non-employed workers (e.g. Flinn 2006). In contrast, the spillovers may reﬂect
relative-pay norms inside the ﬁrm. This is consistent with ﬁndings in Dube, Giuliano and
Leonard (2018), who study the wage adjustment using payroll data from a major retailer
following the 1996-1997 federal minimum wage increase and ﬁnd that worker separations
respond to relative pay diﬀerences.
3.3 Event-speciﬁc estimates
So far, most of our evidence has come from averaging the eﬀects across all 138 events. In this
section, we estimate treatment eﬀects for each of the events separately, and assess how these
impacts vary when we consider minimum wage increases that are more binding.
For this purpose, we create 138 data sets for each event h. The data sets include the
state of event jand all clean control states for 8 year panel by event time. Clean control
states are those that do not have any non-trivial state minimum wage increases in the 8 year
panel around event h; other states are dropped from data set h.We calculate event-speciﬁc
per-capita number of jobs in $1 wage bins relative to the minimum wage for each state-by-year.
Then, the regression equation is,

30In theOnline Appendix B we implement our bunching approach using administrative data from Washing-
ton. In that data we ﬁnd similar spillover eﬀects which suggest that the spillovers are not primarily caused
by CPS-speciﬁc misreporting by survey respondents.

[Page 25 of 116]
missing jobs below ( Dbh), and employment change ( Deh=Dah+Dbh) are similar to the ones
described in section 2.2.Wjstcontrols for other primary, federal, and small events whose
5-year post-treatment periods take place within the data set h. It takes the value of 1 for all
post-treatment periods of these events.31
Figure5panel (a) shows the non-parametric bin-scattered relationship between the event
by event estimates on missing jobs and the new minimum wage.32To calculate the former
we use the ratio of the minimum wage to the median wage, also known as the Kaitzindex
(e.g.,Lee 1999, Dube 2014, Autor, Manning and Smith 2016, Manning 2016). When the
minimum wage is high relative to the median, it is expected to have a larger bite. Consistent
with that expectation, we ﬁnd that events hwith a higher minimum-to-median wage ratio
had substantially more missing jobs — the coeﬃcient on Kaitzhis sizable and statistically
signiﬁcant at -0.133 (s.e. 0.034). At the same time, when we consider excess jobs, we ﬁnd that
the coeﬃcient on Kaitzhhas a very similar magnitude at 0.139 (s.e. 0.057). In other words,
when the minimum wage is high relative to the median, the events have a bigger bite and a
greater number of missing jobs below the new minimum, but also have a nearly equally sized
number of excess jobs at or above the new minimum. As a consequence, the employment
eﬀect is virtually unchanged ( slope =0.006(s.e. 0.048) ) as we consider minimum wages that
range between 37% and 59% of the median wage, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 5.
Overall, these ﬁndings suggest that that the level of the minimum wage increases in the U.S.
that we study have yet to reach a point where the employment eﬀects become sizable.
31The online Appendix Figure C.1reports event-speciﬁc estimates for excess, missing jobs and overall
employment eﬀect, along with (Ferman and Pinto, forthcoming) conﬁdence intervals that are appropriate for
a single treated unit and heteroscedasticty. While there is considerable heterogeneity in the bite of the policy,
the distribution of employment estimates is consistent with the sharp null of zero eﬀect everywhere: only
5.3% of estimates are statistically signiﬁcant at the 5 percent level. In addition, the stacked event-by-event
estimates can be also used to estimate the average eﬀect of the minimum wage across events. In Online
Appendix C we report estimates using that approach and show that estimates are very similar to our panel
regression based event study. This shows that issues about negative weighting using staggered treatments
(e.g.,Abraham and Sun, 2018) are unlikely to be driving our results.
32We control for state-level unemployment rate at the time of the minimum wage increase, political
orientation of the state, urban share of the state, and the decade of the minimum wage increase. However,
the results are very similar if we leave out controls see Online Appendix Figure A.8.

4 Employment Changes along the Wage Distribution
in the Classic Two-Way Fixed Eﬀect Regression on log
Minimum Wage
In the previous section, we estimated the impact of minimum wages on the wage distribution
using our event study speciﬁcation. We found that the eﬀect of the minimum wage was
concentrated at the bottom of the wage distribution, and reassuringly we found no indication
of considerable employment changes in the upper tail of the wage distribution (see Figure 2).
The lack of responses $4 above the minimum wage or higher also implies that the eﬀect of
the minimum wage on aggregate employment is close to the estimated employment eﬀect at
the bottom of the wage distribution. Such stability of upper-tail employment is consistent
with the observation that the share of workers aﬀected by the minimum wage changes we
study is too small to aﬀect upper tail employment to a noticeable degree.
In this section, we estimate the eﬀect of the minimum wage on employment throughout
the wage distribution using alternative identiﬁcation strategies to illustrate the advantage
of the distributional approach in diagnosing research designs. Recent empirical literature
using the classic two-way ﬁxed eﬀect speciﬁcation with log minimum wage (TWFE-logMW),
has found large aggregate disemployment eﬀects in the U.S. context (see Meer and West
2016). We decompose the classic two-way ﬁxed eﬀects estimate of log minimum wage on
the state level employment-to-population rate. In Figure 6we divide the total wage-earning
employment in the 1979-2016 Current Population Survey into inﬂation-adjusted $1-wage
bins by state and by year. Then, for each wage bin, we regress that wage bin’s employment
per capita on the contemporaneous, 4 annual lags, and 2 annual leads of log minimum
wage, along with state and time ﬁxed eﬀects.33This distributed lags speciﬁcation is similar
to those used in numerous papers (e.g., Meer and West 2016, Allegretto et al. 2017).34
The histogram bars show the average post-treatment eﬀect divided by the sample average
employment-to-population rate,35while the dashed purple line plots the running sum of the
33In the TWFE-logMW model, the point estimates for the leads and lags show the impact relative to the
employment in the 3rd year or earlier. Once we normalize the TWFE-logMW estimates to the ﬁrst lead, we
can report 3 leads and 4 lags, similarly to our benchmark estimates.
34Meer and West (2016) present unweighted results on the total employment eﬀect of the minimum wage.
Here we present estimates weighted by the population size as it is more standard in the literature and also
closer to our event study estimates. However, as we show in the Online Appendix Figure A.10, the unweighted
estimates are similar.
35We construct the cumulative response over event dates 0, 1, ..., 4 relative to event date -1 by successively
summing the coeﬃcients for contemporaneous and lagged minimum wages. We then average the cumulative
responses over dates 0,1, ... , 4. This average post-treatment eﬀect is analogous to what we did in our
event-based analysis in the previous sections.
24

[Page 27 of 116]
employment eﬀects of the minimum wage up to the particular wage bin. The ﬁnal purple bar
represents the estimated eﬀect on aggregate employment to population rate.
Figure6panel (a) shows that, on average, minimum wage shocks are associated with
large employment changes in the real dollar bins in the $6 to $9/hour range. There is a sharp
decrease in employment in the $6/hour and $7/hour bins, likely representing a reduction
in jobs paying below new minimum wages; and a sharp rise in the number of jobs in the
$8/hour and $9/hour wage bins, likely representing jobs paying above the new minimum. At
the same time, the ﬁgure also shows consistent, negative employment eﬀects of the minimum
wage for levels far above the minimum wage: indeed, the aggregate negative employment
elasticity (e.g. -0.137) accrues almost entirely in wage bins exceeding $15/hour.
It strikes us as implausible that a minimum wage increase in the $8 to $9/hour range
causally leads to losses of jobs mostly at or above the median wage, even though the minimum
wage is binding far lower in the wage distribution. More plausibly, this suggests that the
speciﬁcation is confounded by negative employment shocks to the upper part of the wage
distribution (possibly much earlier than the actual treatment dates), and these shocks are not
fully absorbed by the simple two-way ﬁxed eﬀect speciﬁcations estimated using a long panel.
For instance, as shown in Online Appendix F, the negative employment changes shown in
Figure6arise only for the Card and Krueger low probability group, which should not be
aﬀected by the minimum wage. At the same time, the high and medium probability groups
exhibit no negative disemployment eﬀect.
How is it possible that our benchmark speciﬁcation that focuses on employment changes
around the event window leads to such diﬀerent results compared to the TWFE-logMW
speciﬁcation? The diﬀerences in the estimates suggest that the negative employment changes
in upper part of the wage distribution in TWFE-logMW must come from outside of the
event window. Indeed, we ﬁnd that the employment losses are driven by the 1980s expansion
and the 1990-91 recessions even though most of the minimum wage changes in our sample
occurred after 2000. When we restrict the regression to the 1992-2016 period—the period
where 86% (118/138) of all our events occurred—we indeed ﬁnd very similar estimates across
the two speciﬁcations. Moreover, even if we limit our sample to the 39 states with no state
minimum wage increases until the late 1990s, the negative disemployment eﬀects are driven
entirely by the inclusion of a period (1980s) long before any cross-state variation in treatment
occurred in these states (see Online Appendix Table F.3).
We also ﬁnd that the overall employment-to-population rate evolved very similarly between
the early 1990s and 2016 in high minimum wage states (those that instituted a minimum
exceeding the federal standard after the early 1990s) and low minimum wage states (where
the federal standard was always binding). This is noteworthy because the period between the
25
----------------------------------------

[Page 28 of 116]
early 1990s and 2016 is when much of the cross-sectional variation in minimum wages emerged.
Importantly, however, the employment-to-population rate had diverged between these two
groups of states during the 1980s, at least a decade before most high minimum wage states
started to raise their minimum wage. This creates a spurious correlation between employment
changes in the 1980s and minimum wage changes in the early 2000s that confounds the
TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation, which is sensitive to shocks occurring long before the event
window. However, this does not aﬀect our event study estimates, since these only consider
employment changes within the event window. This also explains why we do not ﬁnd any
pre-existing trends in our event based analysis, while the TWFE-logMW in the full sample
exhibits sizable and statistically signiﬁcant leads (see further details in Online Appendix F).36
The above example illustrates that showing the eﬀect of the minimum wage throughout
the wage distribution can provide additional falsiﬁcation tests and therefore be an useful
tool for model selection. This type of model selection tool can be particularly helpful in the
context of minimum wages, where the literature has often grappled with ﬁguring out the
“right” empirical model.
5 Discussion
We propose a novel approach that infers the employment eﬀects of the minimum wage from
the change in the frequency distribution of wages. The key advantage of this approach is
that it allows us to assess the overall impact of the minimum wage on low-wage workers, who
are the primary target of minimum wage policies. We use an event study analysis exploiting
138 prominent minimum wage increases and provide a robust and comprehensive assessment
of how minimum wages aﬀect the frequency distribution of wages. Second, we calculate the
number of missing jobs just below the minimum wage, the number of excess jobs at or slightly
above the minimum wage, and also the job changes in the upper tail of the wage distribution.
Our main estimates show that the number of excess jobs at and slightly above the minimum
wage closely matches the number of missing jobs just below the minimum wage, while we
ﬁnd no evidence for employment changes at or more than $4 above the minimum wage. A
36Why are the expansion in the 1980s and the downturn in the 1991-1992 recession related to future
minimum wage changes? Because the expansion and downturn were more pronounced for states that would
be more Democratic-leaning in the 2000s. One possibility is that the 1990-1991 recession was so severe in
some states that it changed the political landscape and opened the door for candidates supporting minimum
wages. However, another explanation is that the 1990-1991 recession just happened to be more pronounced
for Democratic-leaning states—states that would also be more inclined to raise the minimum wage starting
in the early 2000s following a long period of federal inaction. In Online Appendix F we show that this latter
explanation ﬁts the data better. In particular, we show that the predictive power of the severity of recession
on future minimum wage increases disappears once we control for the partisan voting index (PVI) in the
2000s and instrument that variable with the PVI in 1988 (i.e., prior to the 1991-1992 recession).
26
----------------------------------------

[Page 29 of 116]
similar pattern obtains for low-skilled workers, suggesting labor-labor substitution is unlikely
to be a factor in our setting. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the level of the minimum wages that we
study—which range between 37% and 59% of the median wage—have yet to reach a point
where the job losses become sizable. However, the employment consequences of a minimum
wage that surpass the ones studied here remain an open question. Furthermore, if minimum
wage increases aﬀect tradable sectors more, our ﬁndings suggest employment eﬀects may be
more pronounced.
A key advantage of tracking job changes throughout the wage distribution is that we can
transparently show the source of any disemployment eﬀects. As a result, we can detect when
an empirical speciﬁcation suggests an unrealistic impact on the shape of the wage distribution.
More importantly, the relationship between minimum wages and the wage distribution can
also be used to infer the structure of low-wage labor markets. While providing a uniﬁed
theoretical framework is beyond the scope of this paper, our empirical results on the wage
distribution together with the estimates on labor-labor substitution across demographic
groups and the heterogenous responses across sectors provide new empirical ﬁndings which
can be used to test and distinguish various theories of the low-wage labor market.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the frequency distribution of hourly wages. The
red solid line shows the wage distribution before, and the blue solid line after the introduction of the minimum
wage. Since compliance is less than perfect, some earners are uncovered and the post-event distribution starts
before the minimum wage. For other workers, shown by the red shaded area between origin and MW ( Db),
introduction of minimum wage may increase their wages, or those jobs may be destroyed. The former group
creates the “excess jobs above” ( Da), shown by the blue shaded area between MWandW, the upper limit
for any eﬀect of minimum wage on the earnings distribution. The overall change in employment due to the
minimum wage ( De) is the sum of the two areas (Da+Db).

increase on the missing jobs below the new minimum wage (blue line) and on the excess jobs at and slightly

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the main results for new entrants (panel a) and for incumbents (panel b) from our
event study analysis (see equation 1) exploiting 138 state-level minimum wage changes between 1979-2016.
The blue bars show for each dollar bin the estimated change in the number of new entrants in that bin 1-year
post-treatment relative to the total employment of the new entrants 1 year before the treatment. The green
bars show the equivalent for incumbents. Incumbent workers were employed a year prior to the minimum
wage increase, whereas new entrants were not. The error bars show the 95% conﬁdence interval calculated
using standard errors that are clustered at the state level. The green and blue lines show the running sum of
employment changes up to the wage bin they correspond to for new entrants and incumbents, respectively.
The ﬁgures highlight that the ripple eﬀect of the minimum wage mainly comes from incumbent workers.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the binned scatter plots for missing jobs, excess jobs, and total employment changes
by value of the minimum-to-median wage ratio (Kaitz index) for the 130 event-speciﬁc estimates. The 130
events exclude 8 minimum wage raising events in the District of Columbia, since individual treatment eﬀects
are very noisily estimated for those events. The minimum-to-median wage ratio is the new minimum wage
MWdivided by the median wage at the time of the minimum wage increase (Kaitz index). The bin-scatters
and linear ﬁts control for decade dummies, state-speciﬁc unemployment rate at the time of the minimum
wage increase, the urban share of the state’s population, and an indicator for being a Republican-leaning
state. Estimates are weighted by thestate populations. The slope (and robust standard error in parentheses)
is from the weighted linear ﬁt of the outcome on the minimum-to-median wage ratio.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution in ﬁxed eﬀects (TWFE-
logMW) speciﬁcation. We estimate two-way (state and year) ﬁxed eﬀects regressions on the contemporaneous
log minimum wage, as well as on 4 annual lags and 2 annual leads. For each wage bin we run a separate
regression, where the outcome is the number of jobs per capita in that state-wage bin. The cumulative
response for each event date 0, 1,...,4 is formed by successively adding the coeﬃcients for the contemporaneous
and lagged log minimum wages. The green histogram bars show the mean of these cumulative responses for
event dates 0, 1,...,4, divided by the sample average employment-to-population rate —and represents the
average elasticity of employment in each wage bin with respect to the minimum wage in the post-treatment
period. The 95% conﬁdence intervals around the point estimates are calculated using clustered standard
errors at the state level. The dashed purple line plots the running sum of the employment eﬀects of the
minimum wage up until the particular wage bin. The rightmost purple bar is the elasticity of the overall state
employment-to-population with respect to minimum wage, obtained from regressions where the outcome
variable is the state level employment-to-population rate. In the bottom left corner we also report the point
estimate on this elasticity with standard errors that are clustered at the state level. Regressions are weighted
by state population. The ﬁgure highlights that large aggregate disemployment eﬀects are often driven by
shifts in employment at the upper tail of the wage distribution.

Notes.The table reports the eﬀects of a minimum wage increase based on the event study analysis (see equation 1) exploiting
138 state-level minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016. The table reports ﬁve year averaged post-treatment estimates on
missing jobs up to $4 below the new minimum wage, excess jobs at and up to $5 above it, employment and wages. Column (1)
shows the benchmark speciﬁcation while Columns (2)-(6) explore robustness to bin-state time trends and bin-division-period ﬁxed
eﬀects. Column (7) reports the simpler methodology estimates where we calculate changes in aﬀected wage and employment by
using state-by-quarter data, where the outcomes are the number of jobs or total wage bill under $15 per hour. Regressions are
weighted by state-quarter aggregated population. Robust standard errors in parentheses are clustered by state. Signiﬁcance levels
are * 0.10, ** 0.05, *** 0.01.
Line-by-line description.The ﬁrst two rows report the change in number of missing jobs below the new minimum wage ( Db), and
excess jobs above the new minimum wage ( Da) relative to the pre-treatment total employment. The third row, the percentage change
in average wages in the aﬀected bins, (% DW), is calculated using equation 2in Section 2.2. The fourth row, percentage change in
employment in the aﬀected bins is calculated by dividing change in employment by jobs below the new minimum wage (Da+Db

Notes.The table reports eﬀects of a minimum wage increase by demographic groups based on the event study analysis (see equation 1) exploiting 138 state-level

excess jobs at and up to $5 above it, employment and wages for individuals without a high school degree (Column 1), for individuals with high school degree or less
schooling (Column 2), for teens (Column 3), for women (Column 4), for black or Hispanic workers (Column 5). Columns (6)-(8) report the results for groups of workers
with diﬀerential probability of being exposed to the minimum wage changes. We use the Card and Krueger (1995) demographic predictors to estimate the probability of
being exposed (see the text for details). Column 6 shows the results for the workers who have a high probability of being exposed to the minimum wage increase,
Column (7) for the middle probability group, and Column (8) for the low probability group. All speciﬁcations include wage bin-by-state and wage bin-by period ﬁxed

Notes.The table reports the eﬀects of a minimum wage increase on wages based on the event
study analysis (see equation 1) exploiting 138 state-level minimum wage changes between
1979 and 2016. The table reports the percentage change in aﬀected wages with (Column
1) and without (Column 2) taking spillovers into account for all workers, workers without
a high school degree, teens, individuals with high school or less schooling, women, black or
Hispanic workers, in tradable industries, in non-tradable industries, those who were employed
1 year before the minimum wage increase (incumbents); and those who did not have a job 1
year before (new-entrants). The ﬁrst column is the estimated change in the aﬀected wages
calculated according to the equation 2in Section 2.2, and the second column assumes no
spillovers (see equation 3in Section 3.2). In the last column, the spill-over share of the wage
eﬀect is calculated by subtracting 1 from the ratio of the estimates in the second to the ﬁrst
column. Robust standard errors in parentheses are clustered by state; signiﬁcance levels are *
0.10, ** 0.05, *** 0.01.

Additional Figures and Tables
FigureA.1shows all minimum wage increases between 1979 and 2016. We use the time series
of state-level minimum wage changes from Vaghul and Zipperer (2016). Blue circles show the
minimum wage events that are used in the event study analysis. The light orange triangles
represent small minimum wage changes that we do not analyze (but control for). For these
changes, the minimum wage increased either by less than $0.25 (the size of our wage bins) or
by less than 2 percent of the workforce earned between the new and the old minimum wage.
Finally, the green circles indicate federal changes, which we also exclude from our primary
sample of treatments because the change in missing number of jobs, Db, is identiﬁed only
from time-series variation for these events as there are no “control states” with wage ﬂoors
lower than the new minimum wage. The ﬁgure highlights that around 70% (99/138) of the
minimum wage changes in our sample occurred after 2000.
Some wages in the CPS are imputed. In most of our analysis we use only non-imputed
wages. This might be of concern if the imputation rate changes in response to the minimum
wage, or is correlated with minimum wage changes for some other reason. Figure A.2shows
event study estimates where the outcome is the state-level imputation rate. The ﬁgure shows
that minimum wage events studied here have no apparent eﬀect on the imputation rate.
Our deﬁnition of "overall employment" does not include self-employed workers, who are
not covered by the minimum wage. (Note that QCEW does not include self-employed either).
The exclusion of self-employed can be problematic if minimum wages shift employees to
self-employment. Figure A.3(“Impact of Minimum Wages on the Self- Employment”) shows
that the self-employment rate (i.e., self employed workers divided by wage and salary plus
self-employed workers) is not aﬀected by the minimum wage. This conﬁrms that there is not
any shift to self-employment induced by the minimum wage.
FigureA.4plots the evolution of wage and total employment change for aﬀected workers
over annualized event time using our baseline speciﬁcation with wage-bin-period and wage-
bin-state ﬁxed eﬀects. The upper graph in Figure A.4illustrates the clear, statistically
signiﬁcant rise in the average wage of aﬀected workers at date zero, which persists over the
ﬁve year post-intervention period. In contrast, the lower panel in Figure A.4shows that there
is no corresponding change in employment over the ﬁve years following treatment. Moreover,
employment changes were similarly small during the three years prior to treatment.
FigureA.5shows the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution when we take
into account that sometimes minimum wage increases are phased in over multiple events. In
65% of the cases we study, a primary minimum wage increase is followed by a secondary one
within 5 years, on average at $0.56 above the minimum for the primary event. In contrast
to the main results of the paper, where we show the partial eﬀect of each event, here we
show the cumulative eﬀect of both primary and secondary events by taking into account
the incidence and size of secondary increases averaged across our sample of events. The
cumulative eﬀect of primary and secondary events on missing jobs is 2.5%, which is larger
than the partial eﬀect of the primary events, which is 1.8% (see Figure 2). Therefore, the
presence of multiple events can explain some of the diﬀerence between the jobs below the
new minimum wage—which is around 8.6%—and the missing jobs below the new minimum
42

[Page 45 of 116]
wage—which is around 1.8%— in the main analysis.
FigureA.6compares our main estimates of own wage elasticity of employment to the
estimates in the previous literature. The estimates from the previous literature are obtained
fromHarasztosi and Lindner (2016), using studies that reported both employment and wage
estimates. We report the benchmark estimates from Column 1 in Table 1and the Card
and Krueger high probability groups from Column 6 in Table 2. The dashed line shows the
lower bound estimates of our benchmark speciﬁcation. The Figure A.6points out that our
benchmark estimates can rule out 7 out of 11 negative estimates in the literature. When we
additionally focus on the Card and Krueger high-probability group, our estimates rule out 8
of those 11 negative estimates.
Panel (a) in Figure A.7plots the relationship between missing jobs below (multiplied by
-1) and the excess jobs above the new minimum wage for the various subgroups in Table 2.
While there is large variation in the missing jobs across various demographic groups, they
are matched closely by excess jobs above the new minimum wage. The dashed line is the
45-degree line and depicts the locus of points where the missing and excess jobs are equal
in magnitude ( Da=−Db). In all cases, except for the black or Hispanic group, the excess
jobs are larger than the missing jobs indicating a positive albeit statistically insigniﬁcant
employment eﬀect. For black or Hispanic individuals, the diﬀerence between excess and
missing jobs is negligible.
Panel (b) in Figure A.7plots the relationship between missing jobs below (multiplied by -1)
and the excess jobs above the new minimum wage for fully partitioned education-age groups.
We use 4 education categories and 6 age categories, yielding a total of 23 education-by-age
groups.37For each of these 23 groups, we separately estimate a regression using our baseline
speciﬁcation, and calculate changes in missing ( Dbg) and excess jobs ( Dag) for each of them.
Each grey circle represents one age-education group, while the blue squares show the binned
scatterplot. We also report the linear ﬁt (red line) and the 45-degree (dashed) line that depicts
the locus of points where the missing and excess jobs are equal in magnitude ( Da=−Db).
The ﬁgure can be used to assess labor-labor substitution across various demographic groups.
If there is no employment eﬀect in any of the groups, the slope coeﬃcient µ1from regressing
Dag=µ0+µ1×(−Dbg)should be close to one; under this scenario, diﬀerences across groups
in the number of excess jobs at or above the minimum wage exactly mirrors the diﬀerence
in the number of missing jobs below. In contrast, if employment declines are more severe
for lower skilled groups—for whom the bite (- Db) is expected to be bigger—then we should
expect the slope to be less than one, especially for larger values of −Db. As shown in in Figure
A.7, the slope of the ﬁtted line is very close to one, with ˆµ1= 1.070 (s.e.0.075). The binned
scatter plot shows that there is little indication of a more negative slope at higher values
of−Db. While some speciﬁc groups (e.g., individuals with less than high school education
between 30 and 40 years of age) are above the 45 degree line, others (e.g., individuals with
less than high school education between 40 and 50 years of age) are below the line. Overall,
these ﬁndings provide little evidence of heterogeneity in the employment eﬀect by skill level.
FigureA.8shows the event-by-event relationship between missing jobs, excess jobs,
37Education categories are less than high school, high school graduate, some college and college graduate.
Age categories are teens, [20, 30), [30, 40), [40, 50), [50, 60), and 60 and above. We exclude teens with college
degrees from the sample.

employment change and the minimum to median wage (Kaitz index). We plot the bin-
scattered non-parametric relationship without controlling for other characteristics of the
event. The ﬁgure is very similar to our benchmark estimates in Figure 5where we do control
for observable characteristics including urban share, decade dummies and whether the state
leans Republican.
FigureA.9shows the event-by-event relationship between the change in employment and
the minimum to median wage ratio (the Kaitz index). Here we show the raw (and not binned)
scatter plots, where each dot represents one of the 138 events studied in the event study. The
red circles show the 8 minimum wage changes in Washington DC, while the green circles
show the remaining 130 events. The ﬁgure highlights that events from Washington DC are
often outliers, which is not surprising given that the Washington DC sample sizes are very
small in the CPS. To alleviate the inﬂuence of outliers when comparing across events, we
decided to drop Washington DC from our event-by-event analysis in Figure 5and in Figure
A.8. However we keep those events in the rest of the paper where we report the event study
estimates.
FigureA.10shows the impact of minimum wages on the wage distribution in weighted
andunweighted TWFE-logMW speciﬁcations. Panel (a) reports Figure 6from the main text
estimated using (level) ﬁxed eﬀects. Panel (b) reports the unweighted version of Figure 6.
The use of weights has a modest impact on the results.
Obtaining a meaningful “ﬁrst stage” eﬀect of the minimum wage on average wages is
essential for interpreting the estimated employment eﬀects of the minimum wage. Table
A.1compares the t-statistics obtained from estimates of wage elasticities using the preferred
bunching estimator, which infers the wage changes from the bin by bin estimates from
equation 1, and the estimator that runs equation 1at the state-level and uses log of average
state level wage as the outcome variable. Both sets of estimates use the paper’s same
underlying 138 events for the minimum wage increases. In nearly every demographic group,
the bunching estimator’s wage eﬀects are much more precisely estimated and the aggregated
estimator’s wage eﬀects are often not distinguishable from zero at conventional levels of
statistical signiﬁcance. For all workers, the t-statistic for the bunching estimator is 12 times
as large as the t-statistic from the aggregated estimator. Only in the smaller subgroup of
teens does the aggregated estimator’s precision modestly outperform that of the bunching
estimator. In almost all cases, the bunching estimator is able to estimate a wage eﬀect
statistically diﬀerent from zero at the 1 percent level of signiﬁcance. The only exception is
for the low probability CK group, in which the bunching estimator estimates a positive wage
eﬀect statistically distinguishable from zero at the 5 percent level, and where the aggregated
estimator obtains a negative and highly imprecise wage eﬀect estimate.
The bunching method infers job losses from employment changes around the minimum
wage. This has a potential advantage even in the absence of large upper tail employment
changes: ﬁltering out random shocks to jobs in the upper part of the wage distribution can
improve precision of the estimates. Table A.2compares the point estimates and standard
errors of the bunching estimator and an estimator that uses equation 1at the state-level, and
speciﬁed group’s aggregate employment as the outcome variable for calculating the elasticity
of employment with respect to the minimum wage. For almost all the groups, the bunching
estimator is at least as precise as the aggregate estimator, sometimes substantially more so in
the case of smaller demographic groups. Row 1 shows that, for all workers, the point estimates
44

[Page 47 of 116]
of both approaches are rather similar when estimating the policy’s employment elasticity,
with the standard error of the bunching approach modestly smaller, at 88% of the aggregate
estimator. In the cases of workers with lower education, the bunching estimator’s employment
elasticity standard errors are between 65% and 76% of those from the aggregate estimator.
The last three rows of the table examine the the high probability, middle, and low probability
groups described in section 2.2. Only for the middle group does the aggregate estimator
largely outperform the bunching estimator’s precision. (As we discuss in the paragraph
above, however, for this middle group there is no signiﬁcant wage eﬀect detectable using the
aggregate approach, which makes the precision meaningless.)
As a further check on the correlation between minimum wages and the imputation rate of
wages, Table A.3shows the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the imputation rate using various
alternative speciﬁcations. All speciﬁcations conﬁrm that minimum wages have no impact on
the imputation rate.
TableA.4explores the robustness of the benchmark analysis shown in Column 1 of Table
1. In column (1) of Table A.4, we focus on the eﬀect for events that take place in the 7 states
without a tip credit, where the same minimum wage is applied to tipped and non-tipped
employees.38Even if the share of the workforce earning below the new minimum wage (9.9%)
in these states are similar to those in the primary sample, the bite of the policy is larger in the
no-tip-credit states: missing jobs are 2.7% of pre-treatment employment in the no-tip-credit
sample as compared to 1.8% in the full sample. However, the larger number of missing jobs
is almost exactly compensated by an excess number of jobs above the minimum wage, which
amount to 2.6% of pre-treatment employment. The resulting employment elasticity with
respect to own wage is −0.139(s.e. 0.530).
In the second column of Table A.4, we expand the event deﬁnition to include (nontrivial)
federal minimum wage increases, which produces a total of 369 events. Here we ﬁnd the
missing jobs ( Db) to be slightly larger in magnitude at 2.0% of pre-treatment employment.
The wage eﬀect for aﬀected workers is 6.7% and statistically signiﬁcant. The employment
elasticities with respect to the minimum wage and own wage are both close to zero at -0.009
(s.e. 0.019) and -0.157 (s.e. 0.32), respectively. For federal increases, the change in the
number of missing jobs below, Db, is identiﬁed only using time series variation, since there
are no covered workers earning below the new minimum in control states. However, Da+Db
is identiﬁed using cross-state variation, since at least for the 1996-1997 increase and especially
for the 2007-2009 increase there are many control states with covered employment $4 above
the new federal minimum wage. Overall, we ﬁnd it reassuring that the key ﬁnding of a small
employment elasticity remains even when we consider federal increases.
In column (3) of Table A.4, we consider the number of hours employed and estimate
the eﬀect of the minimum wage on full-time equivalent (FTE) workers. These estimates are
not very diﬀerent from Table 1. The actual number of FTE jobs below the minimum wage
(relative to the pre-treatment employment) is lower ( b−1=6.7% as opposed to 8.6% in Table
1), indicating that low-wage workers work fewer hours. Consistent with this, missing jobs
estimate is also smaller in magnitude when we use an FTE measure (-1.3% instead of -1.8%).
The average wage change for aﬀected workers accounting for hours is 7.3% (s.e 1.2%), while
the employment change is 4.4% (s.e. 3.3%). After accounting for hours, the employment
38These states are Alaska, California, Minnesota, Montana, Nevada, Oregon and Washington.

[Page 48 of 116]
elasticity with respect to the minimum wage and the own wage are 0.029 (s.e. 0.022) and
0.601 (s.e. 442), respectively. The analogous estimates for headcount employment in Table 1
were 0.024 (s.e. 0.025) and 0.411 (s.e. 0.43).
In column (4) of Table A.4, we restrict the sample to hourly workers; we expect these
workers to report their hourly wage information more accurately than our calculation of
hourly earnings (as weekly earnings divided by usual hours) for salaried workers. Although
the actual number of workers below the new minimum wage is close to our benchmark sample
(10.4% vs. 8.6% in Table 1) the missing jobs estimate almost doubles (3.3.% vs. 1.8% in
Table1). As a result, the wage eﬀects are more pronounced for this subset of workers than
the overall sample (9.4% versus 6.8% in Table 1), which is consistent with measurement
error in wages being smaller for those who directly report their hourly wages. Nevertheless,
the employment elasticities with respect to the minimum wage (0.029, s.e. 0.035) and with
respect to the own wage (0.306 s.e. 0.392) are very similar to our benchmark estimates.
In column (5), we exclude workers in tipped occupations, as deﬁned by Autor, Manning
and Smith (2016). Tipped workers can legally work for sub-minimum wages in most states,
and hence may report hourly wages below the minimum wage (as tips are not captured in
the reported hourly wage). As we explained in Section 2.3, such imperfect coverage creates a
discrepancy between the actual level ( ¯b−1) and the change ( Db) in the number of workers
below the new minimum wage; however, it does not create a bias in the bunching estimate
for the change in employment ( Da+Db). Excluding tipped workers reduces the average bite,
¯b−1= 6.1%, while the estimate of missing jobs of -1.6% is close to our benchmark estimate
of -1.8% in Table 1. Consequently, estimated wage eﬀects are larger by around 20% (8.2%
versus 6.8% in Table 1). However, excluding tipping workers has a negligible impact on the
employment estimates: the own-wage employment elasticity is 0.337 as opposed to 0.41 in
Table1.
In column (6), we present estimates using the raw CPS data instead of the QCEW
benchmarked CPS. The missing jobs estimate of -1.8% is essentially the same as the baseline
estimate. The wage (7.7%) and employment (4.6%) estimates as well as the employment
elasticities with respect to the minimum wage (0.039) and own wage (0.590) are slightly more
positive. The beneﬁt of using the QCEW benchmarked CPS is the increased precision of
the estimates. Without benchmarking, the standard errors for the minimum wage and the
own-wage elasticities are 44% and 25% larger than those in column (1) of Table 1.
In column (7) we provide estimates without using population weights. These results
are virtually identical to our benchmark estimates (Column (1) of Table 1). For instance,
the employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage is 0.401 (s.e. 0.418), which
is virtually identical to the weighted estimate of 0.411 (s.e. 0.430). The similarity of the
weighted and unweighted estimates is reassuring, since a substantial diﬀerence between the
two could reﬂect potential misspeciﬁcation (Solon, Haider and Wooldridge 2015).
In column (8), we limit the sample to 1993-2016. The similarity of the employment
elasticity with respect to the minimum wage estimates obtained from post-1992 sample and
from the baseline sample (0.006 (0.026) instead of 0.024 (0.025)) is used below in Online
Appendix F to explain diﬀerences between the ﬁndings of the event-based approach and the
TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation.
Our data is in 25-cent bins and the baseline speciﬁcation treatment indicators are in
1-dollar increments. To allay any concerns, in column (9), we also check the robustness of
46
----------------------------------------

[Page 49 of 116]
our results where the treatment indicators are also in 25 cent increments. In other words,
there are 4 times as many regression coeﬃcients for this speciﬁcation as in our benchmark
speciﬁcation. Obviously, the speciﬁc $0.25 wage bins estimates are noisier than the $1 bin
estimates. However, once we sum up these more nosily estimated coeﬃcients, we obtain
estimates that are highly similar to our baseline results (0.023 (0.026) and 0.401 (0.447)
instead of 0.024 (0.025) and 0.411 (0.430), respectively).
TableA.5explores the sensitivity of the results using alternative thresholds, W, for
calculating the excess jobs at and above the minimum wage. In our baseline speciﬁcation,
we calculate the excess jobs by adding up the impact in the interval between MWand
W=MW +$4. In the table we report results using values for W−MWbetween $2 and $6.
The table shows that the excess jobs estimate increases when the threshold is increased from
$2 (column 2) to $3 (column 3), but beyond that the estimates remain stable. Therefore, our
results are not sensitive to the particular value of Wonce we take into account the presence
of spillovers up to $3 above the minimum wage.
In Table A.6, we consider the robustness of our results to using alternative event windows.
Column 1 repeats our baseline results using a window between event dates -3 and 4 (i.e., the
3rd year before the minimum wage increase and 4th year after). Columns 2 and 4 show that
reducing the post-treatment window end-date to 2, or extending it to 6 has little impact
on the wage or employment estimates. Similarly, columns 4 and 5 show that extending
the pre-treatment start date to -5 or reducing it to -1 also has very limited impact on the
estimates. For example, across all 5 columns, the employment elasticity with respect to the
minimum wage varies between 0.008 and 0.025; the associated standard errors vary between
0.021 and 0.027. Overall, these estimates show that our ﬁndings are not driven by our speciﬁc
choice of the event window.
TableA.7reports estimated wage and employment eﬀects of the aggregate event-based
(panel A), and the bunching (panel B) estimators for the Card and Krueger predicted
probabilitygroups. Whiletheaggregateevent-basedapproachconsiderswageandemployment
of the full group, the bunching approach looks locally at wage and employment changes of
aﬀected workers near the minimum wage. Note that the percentage change in overall average
wage will be considerably smaller than the percentage change in wage at the bottom of the
distribution. Take the case where both employment fell by 5% and wages rose by 5% for
aﬀected workers, but aﬀected workers were only half of total employment. Then aggregate
employment would fall by 2.5%, but average wage will rise by even less, since unaﬀected
workers have higher wages than aﬀected workers. As a result the common way of calculating
employment elasticity–that takes the ratio of the employment eﬀects and wage eﬀect–will
be biased using the aggregate approach; and the smaller the share of aﬀected workers in
the group (so that the average wage of the group is much larger than the wage of aﬀected
workers), the bigger is the bias.
Column1ofTable A.7showstheestimatesforthehighprobabilitygroup. Bothapproaches
estimate a sizable and statistically signiﬁcant wage eﬀects with no indication of disemployment.
The wage and employment elasticities with respect to the minimum wage are 0.187 (s.e.
0.062) and 0.081 (s.e. 0.084) in panel A, respectively, using the aggregate approach; these are
consistent with the ﬁndings in panel B using the bunching estimator. However, the former
approach fails to detect a statistically signiﬁcant wage eﬀect of the policy for the middle and
the low probability groups in columns 2 and 3. The wage elasticity estimates in columns
47
----------------------------------------

[Page 50 of 116]
2 and 3 are 0.065 (s.e. 0.057) and -0.005 (s.e. 0.038). This limits the ability of using the
CK probability group approach by itself to examine the employment eﬀects of the minimum
wage. Since the “ﬁrst stage” wage eﬀect is missing for the latter two groups, it is diﬃcult to
assess the size of the estimated employment eﬀects (0.057 (s.e. 0.047) and 0.001 (s.e. 0.023)
for the middle and low probability groups, respectively). On the other hand, the bunching
estimator captures a sizable and statistically signiﬁcant wage eﬀect for all of the groups
(0.051 (s.e. 0.013) and 0.060 (s.e. 0.032) for the middle, and low probability groups). By
examining changes in the frequency distribution for wages around the minimum wage, the
bunching estimator enables us to establish a causal relationship between the policy and the
employment eﬀects for each of the groups.
TableA.8shows the impact of the minimum wage for incumbents and for new entrants to
the labor force. Since CPS interviews individuals twice (one year apart), we can only assess
a short term impact of the minimum wage for these two subgroups. However, columns (1)
and (2) highlight that the short term and the long term impact of the minimum wage is
very similar for the overall sample. By matching the CPS over time, we lose observations
either because matching is not possible, or because there are “bad” matches (see Online
Appendix D for details). Finally, we can only observe past employment status in the second
period, so we can only use half of the observations in the matched sample. This shrinks
our primary sample size from 4,694,104 to 1,505,192. The results from this matched sample
is shown in column (3). The missing jobs are exactly the same as in the baseline (column
1), however, the excess jobs are slightly lower (1.8% in column 3 vs. 2.1% in baseline). As
a result, the change in aﬀected jobs is slightly smaller than in the baseline estimate, but
it is still statistically insigniﬁcant and positive in sign. Columns (4) and (5) decompose
these changes by incumbents and new entrants. Two thirds of the missing jobs come from
incumbents, while one third from new entrants. However, the change in missing jobs matches
the change in excess jobs in both groups, so the employment eﬀects are very similar (0.9%
for incumbents and 0.8% for new entrants). At the same time, the wage eﬀects are diﬀerent,
since new entrants do not experience any spillover eﬀects (see Figure 4).
TableA.9shows estimates for the event-by-event analysis presented in Figure 5using
alternative speciﬁcations. The estimated relationship between the Kaitz index on the jobs
below, on the missing jobs, on the excess jobs, and on the employment change are similar
across various speciﬁcations, which underlines the robustness of the results presented in
Figure5.
TableA.10shows the estimated employment elasticities using our event-based approach,
as well as distributed lag speciﬁcations in log minimum wage (with 4 years of lags, contem-
poraneous, and 3 years of leads) estimated in both TWFE-logMW and in ﬁrst diﬀerences
(FD) speciﬁcations (see the details in Online Appendix F). We report employment estimates
on aggregate employment in (columns 1, 2 and 5) and employment under $15 (columns 3,
4 and 6) in Panel A. There is a wide range of estimates for aggregate employment, as we
pointed out in Figure 6. When we exclude employment variation in the upper tail and focus
on employment in jobs under $15, the range of estimates narrows considerably. For example,
for the weighted estimates, the employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage
is -0.020 (s.e. 0.028) in the ﬁxed eﬀect speciﬁcation, -0.005 (s.e. 0.019) in ﬁrst diﬀerence
speciﬁcation, and 0.027 (s.e. 0.022) in the event-based speciﬁcation. These estimates cannot
be distinguished statistically from each other, or from zero. This highlights that variability
48
----------------------------------------

[Page 51 of 116]
in the estimates is mainly driven by variation in employment above $15, which is unlikely to
reﬂect the causal eﬀect of the minimum wage. Column 6 estimates event-based regressions of
the minimum wage on jobs below $15. We refer to this speciﬁcation as the “simpler method”
in Section 2.3and we report the estimates in Column 7 of Table 1. (The slight diﬀerence
between Column 6 in Table A.10and Column 7 in Table 1is that the former is based on
annual data while the latter is based on quarterly data.) Column 7 shows our baseline
estimates where we estimate the eﬀect of the minimum wage on job counts in each wage
bin, calculate the missing and excess jobs and then add them up. Both the point estimates
and the standard errors are very close to each in other in the “simpler method” and in our
baseline regressions.
Panel B of Table A.10shows the TWFE-logMW, ﬁrst diﬀerence (FD), and event-based
(EB) regressions for teens (see the details in Online Appendix F). The variability in the
estimates for teens is not driven by changes in employment in the upper tail. This is not
surprising, since most teens earn below $15, and so variation in the upper tail can only have
limited impact on the estimates. Column 6 estimates event based regression of the minimum
wage on jobs below $15. Column 7 shows our baseline estimates where we estimate the eﬀect
of the minimum wage on job counts in each wage bin, calculate the missing and excess jobs
and then add them up. The estimates with the “simpler method” (column 6) and with our
baseline method (column 7) are very similar. In general, we ﬁnd that the teen estimates
from ﬁxed eﬀects models tend to be more negative than the ﬁrst diﬀerence ones—similar to
Allegretto et al. (2017), and to the estimates for overall employment. Moreover, event-based
estimates are much closer to those using ﬁrst diﬀerencing, again mirroring the ﬁndings for
overall employment.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows all minimum wage increases between 1979 and 2016. There are a total of 623
minimum wage increases. The blue circles show the primary minimum wage events used in estimating
equation 1; the light orange triangles highlight small minimum wage changes where minimum wage increased
less than $0.25 (the size of our wage bins) or where less than 2 percent of the workforce earned between
the new and the old minimum wage. The green circles indicate federal changes, which we exclude from our
primary sample of treatments because the change in missing number of jobs, Db, is identiﬁed only from
time-series variation for these events as there are no “control states” with wage ﬂoors lower than the new
minimum wage (see the text for details).

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the imputation rate. In our event study analysis
we only use non-imputed hourly wages. To alleviate the concern that imputation has an eﬀect on our
estimates, we implement an event study regression where the outcome variable is state-level imputation
rate. Events are the same 138 state-level minimum wage changes between 1979-2016 that we use in our
benchmark speciﬁcation. Similarly to our benchmark speciﬁcation we include state and time ﬁxed eﬀects in
the regression. In the Online Appendix Table A.3we report results with other speciﬁcations. The blue line
shows the evolution of the imputation rate (relative to the year before the treatment). We also show the 95%
conﬁdence interval based on standard errors that are clustered at the state level.

eﬀects on our estimates, we implement an event study regression where the outcome variable is state-level

time, which is calculated using equation 2. Panel (b) shows the evolution of employment between $4 below
the new minimum wage and $5 above it (relative to the total employment 1 year before the treatment), which
is equal to the sum of missing jobs below and excess jobs at and slightly above the minimum wage, Db+Da.
The ﬁgure highlights that minimum wage had a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on the average wage of the
aﬀected population, but there is no sign of signiﬁcant disemployment eﬀects.

Notes: This ﬁgure replicates Figure 2in the main text, but calculates a cumulative eﬀect when there are
multiple events in the 5-year post-treatment window. Overall, 65% of the time, a primary minimum wage
increase is followed by a secondary one within 5 years, on average at $0.56 above the minimum for the primary
event. Figure 2shows the partial eﬀect of each event. Here we show the cumulative eﬀect of all events within
a 5-year post-treatment window by taking into account the incidence and size of secondary increases averaged
across our sample of events. The blue bars show for each dollar bin (relative to the minimum wage) the
estimated average employment changes in that bin during the 5-year post-treatment relative to the total
employment in the state one year before the treatment. The red line is the running sum of the bin-speciﬁc
impacts. Adjusting for multiple events increases the estimate for missing jobs below the new minimum from
1.8% to 2.5%. Therefore, some of the diﬀerence between jobs below the new minimum wage, which is around
8.6%, and the missing jobs below the new minimum wage can be explained by multiple events following each
other.

Estimated Employment Elasticity With Respect To Own Wage
Notes: This ﬁgure summarizes the estimated employment elasticity with respect to wage and compares it
to the previous estimates in the literature. The estimates in the literature are collected by Harasztosi and
Lindner(2016). The two estimates from our paper is the benchmark estimate on overall employment (Column
1 in Table 1) and the estimates for the Card and Krueger high probability group Column 6 in Table 2. The
dashed vertical line shows the lower bound of our benchmark estimates. The benchmark estimates can rule
out 7 out of the 11 negative estimates provided in the previous literature.

Notes: Both ﬁgures show the excess jobs (relative to the pre-treatment total employment in that group)
above the new minimum wage ( Da) and magnitude of missing jobs below it ( −Db) for various demographic
groups. The black dash line in both of the graphs are the 45 degree line indicating the locus of points where
the excess number of jobs above and the missing jobs below the new minimum wage are exactly the same,
and so the employment eﬀect is zero. Estimates above that line indicate positive employment eﬀects, and
estimates below the line indicate negative ones. Panel (a) shows the estimates for demographic groups in
Table2: those with less than high school (LTHS) education, high school or less (HSL) education, women,
teen, black or Hispanic workers (B/H), and groups with low, medium and high probability of being exposed
to the minimum wage increase. Panel (b) shows the estimates for education-by-age groups generated from 6
age and 4 education categories. The small light gray and black points correspond to each of the groups, while
the large blue squares show the non-parametric bin scattered relationship between the excess jobs ( Da) and
the magnitude of missing jobs ( −Db). The red line shows the linear ﬁt. A slope of that line below one would
indicate the presence of labor-labor substitution across age and eduction groups.

shows the binned scatter plots for missing jobs, excess jobs, and total employment changes by value of the
minimum-to-median wage ratio (Kaitz index) for the 130 event-speciﬁc estimates. The minimum-to-median
wage ratio is the new minimum wage MWdivided by the median wage at the time of the minimum wage
increase (Kaitz index). The 130 events exclude 8 minimum wage raising events in the District of Columbia,
since those events are very noisily estimated in the CPS. The bin scatters and linear ﬁts plot the relationship
without any control variables. Estimates are weighted by the state populations. The slope (and robust
standard error in parentheses) is from the weighted linear ﬁt of the outcome on the minimum-to-median wage
ratio.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution using ﬁxed eﬀects
speciﬁcations (TWFE-logMW), with and without population weights. Both panels estimate two-way (state-
bin and year) ﬁxed eﬀects regressions on contemporaneous as well as 2 annual leads, and 4 annual lags
of log minimum wage (panel (a) is the same as Figure 6in the main text). For each wage bin we run
a separate regression, where the outcome is the number of jobs per capita in that state-wage bin. The
cumulative response for each event date 0, 1, ..., 4 is formed by successively adding the coeﬃcients for
the contemporaneous and lagged log minimum wages. The green bars show the mean of these cumulative
responses for event dates 0, 1, ..., 4, divided by the sample average employment-to-population rate —and
represents the average elasticity of employment in each wage bin with respect to the minimum wage in
the post-treatment period. The 95% conﬁdence intervals around the point estimates are calculated using
clustered standard errors at the state level. The dashed purple line plots the running sum of the employment
eﬀects of the minimum wage up until the particular wage bin. The rightmost purple bar in each of the graphs
is the elasticity of the overall state employment-to-population rate with respect to minimum wage, obtained
from regressions where outcome variables are the state level employment-to-population rate. In the bottom
left corner we also report the point estimate on this elasticity with standard errors that are clustered at the
state level. Regressions in panels (a) are weighted by state population; whereas the ones in panels (b) are not
weighted. 59

Notes.Each cell reports the t-statistic from the esti-
mated wage eﬀect with respect to the minimum wage for
various demographic groups. The bunching approach is
the preferred speciﬁcation in this paper, estimating the
wage eﬀect from bin-speciﬁc employment changes near
the relevant minimum wage. The aggregated approach
uses as the outcome overall aggregate employment. For
the bunching case, the wage eﬀect is the estimated per-
centage change of aﬀected workers. For the aggregated
case, the wage eﬀect is the elasticity of the wage with
respect to the minimum wage. Regressions are weighted
by state averaged population of the demographic groups.
T-statistics are obtained by dividing the estimated wage
eﬀects by robust standard errors clustered by state.

bin-speciﬁc employment per capita changes as the outcome. The aggregate approach uses
overall employment per-capita as the outcome. Robust standard errors in parentheses

Notes.The table reports 5-year averaged change in the imputation rate of the CPS from 1979 to 2016 after
the primary 138 events. The dependent variable is the imputation rate, deﬁned as the number of imputed
observations divided by the number of employed observations. The estimates are calculated by employing an
event based approach, where we regress state imputation rates on quarterly leads and lags on treatment
spanning 12 quarters before and 19 quarters after the policy change. All speciﬁcations include state, and
quarter ﬁxed eﬀects. Columns 2, 4, 6, and 8 controls for state linear trends; whereas columns 3, 4, 7, and 8
allow census divisions to be aﬀected diﬀerently by macroeconomic shocks. The regressions are not weighted
in columns 1-4; and they are population weighted in columns 5-8. Robust standard errors in parentheses are

Notes.The
table reports robustness checks for the eﬀects of a minimum wage increase based on the event study analysis (see equation 1) exploiting minimum wage changes between
1979 and 2016. All columns except column (2) are based on state-level minimum wage changes. The table reports ﬁve year averaged post-treatment estimates on missing jobs up to $4
below the new minimum wage, excess jobs at and up to $5 above it, employment and wages. Column (1) reports estimates for the 44 events which occured in states that do not allow
tip credit. Column (2) reports estimates using 369 state or federal minimum wage increases. Column (3) uses full time equivalent job counts and so takes changes in hours worked into
account. Column (4) uses workers who directly reported being hourly workers in the survey. Column (5) uses workers in non-tipped occupations only. Column (6) does not use the
QCEW benchmarking, and instead reports the estimates calculated using the raw CPS counts (see Section 4.2 for details). All regressions are weighted by state-quarter aggregated
population except Column (7), where we report unweighted estimates. Column (8) only considers minimum wage events that happened on or before 2012q1 to ensure a full ﬁve
year post-treatment period. Column (9) shows the results for the post-1992 sample. Column (10) deﬁnes treatment indicators in 25 cent increments. All speciﬁcations include wage
bin-by-state and wage bin-by period ﬁxed eﬀects. Robust standard errors in parentheses are clustered by state; signiﬁcance levels are * 0.10, ** 0.05, *** 0.01.
Line-by-line description.The ﬁrst two rows report the change in number of missing jobs below the new minimum wage ( Db), and excess jobs above the new minimum wage ( Da) relative
to the pre-treatment total employment. The third row, the percentage change in average wages in the aﬀected bins, (% DW), is calculated using equation 2in Section 2.2. The fourth
row, percentage change in employment in the aﬀected bins is calculated by dividing change in employment by jobs below the new minimum wage (Da+Db
¯b−1). The ﬁfth row, employment
elasticity with respect to the minimum wage is calculated asDa+Db
%DM
Wwhereas the sixth row, employment elasticity with respect to the wage, reports1
%DWDa+Db
¯b−1. The line on the number
of observations shows the number of quarter-bin cells used for estimation, while the number of workers refers to the underlying CPS sample used to calculate job counts in these cells.

Notes.The table reports the eﬀects of a minimum wage increase based on the event study analysis (see
equation 1) exploiting 138 state-level minimum wage changes between 1979-2016. The table reports ﬁve
year averaged post-treatment estimates on missing jobs up to $4 below the new minimum wage, excess jobs,
employment and wages. The diﬀerent columns explore the robustness of the results to alternative upper end
points,W, for calculating excess jobs. The ﬁrst column limits the range of the wage window by setting the
upper limit for calculating the excess jobs to W=$2, and the last column expands it until W=$6. All
speciﬁcations include wage bin-by-state and wage bin-by period ﬁxed eﬀects. Regressions are weighted by
state-quarter aggregated population. Robust standard errors in parentheses are clustered by state; signiﬁ-
cance levels are * 0.10, ** 0.05, *** 0.01.
Line-by-line description.The ﬁrst two rows report the change in number of missing jobs below the new min-
imum wage ( Db), and excess jobs above the new minimum wage ( Da) relative to the pre-treatment total
employment. The third row, the percentage change in average wages in the aﬀected bins, (% DW), is cal-
culated using equation 2in Section 2.2. The fourth row, percentage change in employment in the aﬀected
bins is calculated by dividing change in employment by jobs below the new minimum wage (Da+Db
¯b−1). The
ﬁfth row, employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage is calculated asDa+Db
%DMWwhereas the
sixth row, employment elasticity with respect to the wage, reports1

Notes.The table reports estimated overall (panel A) and teen (panel B) employment elasticities of minimum wage from alternative approaches. All
columns show average post-treatment elasticities calculated from regressions of state-level employment to population rate on contemporaneous and 4
annual lags and 2 annual leads of log minimum wages. We use state-by-year aggregated CPS data from 1979-2016. Columns (1) and (3) estimate
two-way (state and year) ﬁxed eﬀect regresions, while in columns (2) and (4) we employ ﬁrst diﬀerences. Column (3) and (4) exclude workers with
hourly wages greater than $15. Columns (5)-(7) report estimates employment elasticities using an event study framework where we exploit the same
138 events as in our benchmark speciﬁcations. In column (5), we use state by quarter aggregated CPS data. In column (6) we directly estimate the
eﬀect of the minimum wage on jobs below $15. We refer to this speciﬁcation as simpler method in Section 4.2., since it directly estimate the sum of
missing and excess jobs. Finally, column (7) shows estimates from the bunching approach (same as in column 1 of Table 1, and column 3 of Table 2).
In all cases we show estimates with and without population weighting. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered by state; signiﬁcance levels are *

Online Appendix B
Washington State Case Study
In this Appendix, we report estimates using administrative data on hourly wages for a case
study of a large state-level minimum wage increase. The state of Washington increased its
real hourly minimum wage by around 22% from $7.51 to $9.18 (in 2016 dollars) in two steps
between 1999 and 2000. Moreover, this increase in the real minimum wage was persistent,
since subsequent increases were automatically indexed to the rate of inﬂation. In addition to
the size and permanence of this intervention, Washington is an attractive case study because
it is one of the few states with high quality administrative data on hourly wages.39Using
hourly wage data, we can easily calculate the actual post-reform wage distribution (blue
line in Figure 1). However, the key challenge implementing the bunching method is that we
do not directly observe the wage distribution in the absence of the minimum wage increase
(red line in Figure 1). To overcome this challenge, the previous literature constructed the
counterfactual by imposing strong parametric assumptions (Meyer and Wise 1983) or simply
used the pre-reform wage distribution as a counterfactual (Harasztosi and Lindner 2016).40
Here we improve upon these research designs by implementing a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences style
estimator.
In particular, we discretize the wage distribution, and count per-capita employment for
each dollar wage bin k. For example, the $10 wage bin includes jobs paying between $10 and
$10.99 in 2016$. We normalize these counts by the pre-treatment employment-to-population
rate in Washington,
eWA,k,Post =1
EWA,Pre
NWA,PreEWA,k,Post
NWA,Post
whereEWA,k,t
NWA,tis per-capita employment for each dollar wage bin kin state Washington at
timet, andNWA,tis the size of the population. We use administrative data on hourly wages
from Washington State to calculate eWA,k,Post .
We calculate the post treatment counterfactual wage distribution for each wage bin,
eCF
WA,k,Post,by adding the (population-weighted) average per capita employment change in
the 39 states that did not experience a minimum wage increase during the 1998-2004 time
period to the Washington state’s pre-treatment per-capita wage distribution. After the
appropriate normalization, this leads to the following expression:
39The state of Washington requires all employers, as part of the state’s Unemployment Insurance (UI)
payroll tax requirements, to report both the quarterly earnings and quarterly hours worked for all employees.
The administrative data covers a near census of employee records from the state. One key advantage of the
bunching method proposed here is that there is no need for conﬁdential or sensitive individual-level data for
implementation. Instead, we rely here on micro-aggregated data on employment counts for 5-cent hourly
wage bins. Workers with hourly wages greater than $50 are censored for conﬁdentiality purposes. We deﬂate
wages to 2016 dollars using the CPI-U-RS.
40As shown in Dickens, Machin and Manning (1998), estimates using the Meyer and Wise 1983 approach is
highly sensitive to the parameterization of the wage distribution.

is the size of the population (age 16 or over) in state sat timet. To calculate the third part
of this expression, the change in control states, we use hourly wage data from the Outgoing
Rotation Group of the Current Population Survey (CPS). We will discuss the data in more
detail in Section 2.3. For the second part of the expression, the pre-treatment Washington
wage distribution, we use administrative data on hourly wages. However, in Appendix Figure
B.4we show that when we use the CPS, we get very similar results. Finally, the ﬁrst part of
this expression, the normalization, is to express the counterfactual employment counts in
terms of pre-treatment total employment in Washington. It is worth highlighting that our
normalization does not force the area below the counterfactual wage distribution to be the
same as the area below the actual wage distribution—in other words, the minimum wage can
aﬀect aggregate employment.
In Figure B.1, panel (a) we report the actual (blue ﬁlled bar) and the counterfactual
(red empty bars) frequency distributions of wages, normalized by the pre-treatment total
employment in Washington. We deﬁne the pre-treatment period as 1996-1998, and the post-
treatment period as 2000-2004. The post-treatment actual wage distribution in Washington
state (blue ﬁlled bars) shows that very few workers earn less than the mandated wage, and
there is a large spike at the new minimum wage at $9. The post-treatment counterfactual
distribution diﬀers considerably. That distribution indicates that in the absence of the
minimum wage increase, there would have been more jobs in the $7 and $8 bins, but fewer
jobs at the $9 bin and above. Compared to the counterfactual wage distribution, the actual
distribution is also elevated $1 and $2 above the minimum wage, which suggests that minimum
wages induce some modest spillover eﬀects. At the same time, the ripple eﬀect of the minimum
wage fades out above $12, and no diﬀerence is found between the actual and counterfactual
distribution above that point. Such a relationship between the actual and counterfactual
distributions closely resembles the illustration of the bunching method shown in Figure 1.
The diﬀerence between the actual, eWA,k,Post , and the counterfactual, eCF
WA,k,Post , fre-
quency distributions of wages represents the causal eﬀect of the minimum wage on the wage
distribution. This diﬀerence can be expressed as:

which is the classic diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimator underlying the core estimates in the
paper. Standard errors are calculated using the procedure proposed by Ferman and Pinto
(forthcoming). Appropriate for a single treated unit, their procedure extends the cluster
residual bootstrap by correcting for sample-size based heteroskedasticity—an important issue
given the very diﬀerent sample sizes across states in the CPS, and because Washington is
based on administrative data.
The blue bars in Panel (b) of Figure B.1report the diﬀerences in job counts for each
wage bin. The diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences estimate shows a clear drop in counts for wage bins
just below the new minimum wage. In the upper part of the table we report our estimate of
missing jobs,/triangleb, which is the sum of employment changes,/summationtext$8
k=$5eWA,k,Post−eCF
WA,k,Post ,
between $5 and $8—i.e., under the new minimum wage. These missing jobs paying below
$9 represent around 4.6% of the aggregate pre-treatment Washington employment. We
also calculate the number of excess jobs paying between $9 and $13, /trianglea, which is equal
to/summationtext$13
k=$9eWA,k,Post−eCF
WA,k,Post . The excess jobs represent around 5.4% of the aggregate
pre-treatment Washington employment.
As we explained in the previous section, the eﬀect of the minimum wage on low-wage jobs
is equal to the sum of the missing jobs below and the excess jobs above the new minimum
wage of $9. We ﬁnd that the net employment change is positive—the increase amounted
to 0.8% of the pre-treatment aggregate employment in Washington. This reﬂects a 6.1%
(s.e. 10.9%) increase in employment for the workers who earned below the new minimum
wage in 1998. We also ﬁnd that average wages of aﬀected workers at the bottom of the
wage distribution increased by around 9.0% (s.e.18.8%) Coming from a single case study, the
precision of these estimates is much lower than in the pooled event study estimates presented
in the main paper.
In Panel (b) of Figure 2, the red line shows the running sum of employment changes up
to each wage bin. The running sum drops to a sizable, negative value just below the new
minimum wage, but returns to around zero once the minimum wage is reached. By around
$2 above the minimum wage, the running sum reaches a small positive value and remains ﬂat
thereafter—indicating little change in upper tail employment. This strengthens the case for
a causal interpretation of these results.
Finally, we also explore the evolution of missing jobs (red line) and excess jobs (blue line)
over time in panel (a) in Online Appendix Figure B.3. The ﬁgure shows that excess and
72
----------------------------------------

[Page 75 of 116]
missing jobs are close to zero before 1999, and there are no systematic pre-existing trends.41
Once the minimum wage is raised in two steps between 1999 and 2000, there is a clear and
sustained drop in jobs below the new minimum wage (relative to the counterfactual). Since
the minimum wage is indexed to inﬂation in Washington, the persistence of the drop is not
surprising. The evolution of excess jobs after 2000 closely matches the evolution of missing
jobs. As a result, the net employment change—which is the sum of missing and excess
jobs—is close to zero in all years following the minimum wage increase (see panel (b) in
FigureB.3).
41There is a one-time, temporary, drop in excess jobs and an increase in missing jobs in 1996, which likely
reﬂects the fact that the 1996 federal minimum increase from $4.25 to $4.75 only aﬀected control states, since
Washington’s minimum wage was already at $4.90 (in current dollars). However, the 1997 federal minimum
wage increase to $5.15 aﬀected both Washington and controls states and hence restored the diﬀerence in
excess and missing jobs prior to Washington’s state minimum wage increase in 1999 and 2000.

Notes: We examine the eﬀect of the 1999-2000 minimum wage change in Washington state on the frequency distribution of
wages (aggregated in $1 bins), normalized by the 1998 level of employment in Washington. The minimum wage was raised from
$7.51 to $9.18 (in 2016 values) and it was indexed by inﬂation afterwards. Panel (a) shows the actual (purple solid bars) and
counterfactual (red outlined bars) wage frequency distribution after the minimum wage increases in Washington. The actual
distribution (post treatment) plots the average employment between 2000 and 2004 by wage-bin relative to the 1998 total
employment in Washington using administrative data on hourly wages between 2000-2004. The counterfactual distribution
adds the average change in employment between 2000 and 2004 in states without any minimum wage change to the mean
1996-1998 job counts (see the text for details). The $26+ bin (the bin that is $17+ above the new minimum wage) contains all
workers earning above $26, and its values shown on the right y-axis. Panel (b) depicts the diﬀerence between the actual and the
counterfactual wage distribution. The blue bars show the change in employment at each wage bin (relative to the 1998 total
employment in Washington). The red line shows the overall employment changes up to that wage bin. The upper right panel
shows the estimates on missing jobs below $9, /triangleb; on the excess jobs between $9 and $13, /trianglea, and on the estimated employment
and wage eﬀects. The standard errors are calculated using the method proposed by Ferman and Pinto (forthcoming).

jobs are calculated using states without any minimum wage change during the 1998-2004 time period. In

in the control states to the mean 1996-1998 job counts in Washington state (see the text for details). The two
vertical dashed black lines at 1998 and 1999 show the that the minimum wage was raised in 1999 and 2000

2001. We exclude all observations with imputed wages in the CPS in forming the counterfactual employment
counts, except for years 1994 and 1995. Since determining imputed wages is not possible for those years, we
use all observations in 1994 and 1995.

Online Appendix C
Event-by-event analysis
While the baseline estimates in this paper are an average eﬀect across 138 events estimated
by equation (1), our event-by-event analysis estimates separate treatment eﬀects for each of
the events. To do so, we ﬁrst create event-speciﬁc annual state panel datasets using the same
real wage bin-state-speciﬁc employment counts as before. Then we calculate event-speciﬁc
estimates using separate regressions for each event.
Each event h-speciﬁc dataset includes the treated state and all other clean control states
for an 8-year panel by event time ( t=−3,...,4)with the minimum wage increase at t= 0.
Clean controls are those without any non-trivial minimum wage increase within the 8-year
event window. With these data we calculate event-speciﬁc per-capita state outcomes over
timeYsth: missing jobs bsth, between the new minimum and $4.00 below; excess jobs asth,
between the minimum and $4.00 above; total aﬀected employment esth=asth+bsth; and
upper tail jobs more than $4.00 above the new minimum. For each event, we have a similar
regression equation to the one used in our baseline estimates
Ysth=4/summationdisplay
τ=−3ατhkIτ
sth+µsh+ρth+Wsth+usth, (C.6)
where Wjshis an indicator that controls for other primary, federal, and small events whose
5-year post-treatment periods take place within the data set h. (Wsth= 1for post-treatment
periods of these events.) Just like our baseline estimates, we calculate the event-speciﬁc change
in excess jobs above ( Daj), change in missing jobs below ( Dbh), and employment change
(Deh=Dah+Dbh) relative to the ﬁrst year prior to treatment. For instance, the change in
the excess number of jobs is given by Dah=1

FigureC.1shows the resulting estimated employment changes for each event, along
with 95% conﬁdence intervals obtained according to the procedure proposed by Ferman
and Pinto (forthcoming). Appropriate for a single treated unit, their procedure extends the
cluster residual bootstrap by correcting for heteroskedasticity—an important issue given
the very diﬀerent sample sizes across states in the CPS. Given the very small sample sizes
for Washington D.C. in the CPS, we exclude these minimum wage increases from the
event-by-event analysis, for a total of 130 events. The ﬁgure shows estimates for missing,
excess, and total employment changes, where ﬁlled in markers represent statistically signiﬁcant
employmentchangesatthe5percentlevel. Thereisclearevidenceofsizablebutheterogeneous
bites across events: 83% (108) of the missing jobs estimates are negative, and 25% (32) of
the events are statistically signiﬁcant at the 5 percent level. At the same time 21% (27) of
the excess jobs estimates are statistically signiﬁcant, while 78% (100) are positive in sign.
Therefore, while there is considerable heterogeneity in the bite of the policy, the distribution
of employment estimates is consistent with the sharp null of zero eﬀect everywhere: only 7
(or 5.3%) of events yield statistically signiﬁcant overall employment changes: 1 is negative
and 6 are positive, and the median estimate is very close to zero.
We can also use the event-by-event estimates to assess whether the lack of leading eﬀects
and upper tail employment changes hold event-by-event, and not just on average. Figure
78
----------------------------------------

[Page 81 of 116]
C.2shows leading and upper tail employment changes for 129 events; here one event from
Connecticut in 1981 is dropped because it lacks a third leading term. Only 5.4% (7) of the
events experience a statistically signiﬁcant upper tail eﬀects at the 5 percent level, while
7.7% (10) the events experience statistically signiﬁcant leading eﬀects. Overall, these results
are reassuring as they show that the lack of upper tail or leading eﬀects in aggregate is not
driven by a mix of unusual positive and negative individual eﬀects. Rather, our ﬁndings are
consistent with the sharp null of zero upper tail and zero leading eﬀects everywhere.
We also stack all of the event-speciﬁc data to calculate an average eﬀect across all the
events using the a single set of treatment eﬀects ατk

This provides an alternative to our baseline panel speciﬁcation that uses a more stringent
criteria for admissible control groups, and is not more robust to possible problems with a
staggered treatment design in presence of heterogeneous treatment eﬀects. In particular, by
aligning events by event-time (and not calendar time), it is equivalent to a setting where
the events happen all at once and are not staggered; this prevents negative weighting of
some events that may occur with a staggered design (Abraham and Sun, 2018). Moreover,
by dropping all states with any events within the 8 year event window, we further guard
against bias due to heterogeneous treatment eﬀects. Moving to the stacked-by-event approach
(column 2 in Table C.1) continues to produce a sizable and statistically signiﬁcant positive
wage eﬀect, but an employment eﬀect that is statistically indistinguishable from zero. The
minimum wage employment elasticity using the stacked-by-event approach (column 2) is
0.001 (s.e. 0.002) which is fairly similar to the estimate of 0.024 (0.25) in the baseline panel
speciﬁcation (column 1). The own wage elasticity is 0.018 (s.e. 0.546) in column 2 as opposed
to 0.411 (s.e., 0.430) in the baseline column 1; here the more stringent stacked-by-event
approach is somewhat less precise, though it still rules out an own wage elasticity more
negative than -0.88 at the 90% conﬁdence level. The time paths for missing jobs, excess jobs
and employment are reported in Figure C.3; again these are quite similar to the baseline
Figures3andA.4and show a sharp and persistent change in missing and excess jobs on the
event date, and a ﬂat employment time path before and after the event.
In column (3) we consider the case were we manually average the 138 estimates where
each event is weighted by population. The point estimates are very similar to column (2),
providing further assurance against the problematic (e.g., negative) implicit weights in the
panel estimate. Finally, in column (4) we further reﬁne the sample by only considering events
that have a full ﬁve year post-treatment sample (i.e., events that occurred on 2012q1 or
earlier). The point estimates are quite close to column (2), even though, as expected, the
standard errors are now somewhat larger. This shows that the small size of our estimates in
columns (1) - (3) is not driven by a lack of a suﬃciently long post-treatment period in some
of the events.

Notes.The table reports the eﬀects of a minimum wage increase based on the event study analysis (see
equation 1) and alternative variants of stacked analysis (see equations 6 and 7) exploiting 138 state-level
minimum wage changes between 1979 and 2016. The table reports ﬁve year averaged post-treatment
estimates on missing jobs up to $4 below the new minimum wage, excess jobs at and up to $5 above it,
employment and wages. The ﬁrst column reproduces column (1) of Table 1 for comparison purposes.
Column (2) uses equation 7. Column (3) uses equation 6 and manually averages each event-by-event
estimates. Column (4) uses the same regression equation as column (2), but uses only events that have
occurred on or before 2012q1 to ensure a full ﬁve year post-treatment sample. Robust standard errors
in parentheses are clustered by event-by-state in columns (1), (2), and (4). In column (3), we employ
the procedure proposed by Ferman and Pinto (forthcoming) to obtain the standard errors. Signiﬁcance

Data Appendix
The primary data set we use in the event study analysis is the individual-level NBER Merged
Outgoing Rotation Group of the Current Population Survey for 1979-2016 (CPS). We use
variables EARNHRE (hourly wage), EARNWKE (weekly earnings), and UHOURSE (usual
hours) to construct our hourly wage variable. For the period after 1995q4, we exclude
observations with imputed hourly wages (I25a>0) among those with positive EARNHRE
values, and exclude observations for which usual weekly earnings or hours information is
imputed (I25a>0 or I25d>0) among those with positive EARNWKE values. There is no
information on the imputation between 1994q1 and 1995q3 so we exclude these observations
entirely. For the years 1989-1993, we follow the methodology of Hirsch and Schumacher
(2004) to determine imputed observations.
The CPS is a survey, where only a subset of workers is interviewed each month; therefore,
there is sampling error in the dataset. In addition, as we do not use observations with imputed
hourly wages in most of our analysis, the employment counts of the raw CPS data are biased
downwards. To reduce the sampling error and also address the undercounting due to dropping
imputed observations, our primary sample combines the CPS wage densities with the true
state-level employment counts from the QCEW ( E). Speciﬁcally, in the QCEW benchmarked
CPS, the employment counts for a wage bin wis calculated as/hatwidestEw
NQCEW
=/hatwiderfwCPS×E
N, where
/hatwiderfwCPSis the (discretized) wage density estimated using the CPS: ˆfwCPS=Prob (w≤wage<
w+ 0.25). We also do a similar benchmarking of NAICS-based industry-and-state-speciﬁc
QCEW employment (between 1990 and 2016) when we conduct sectoral analysis.
Inaddition, weusemicro-aggregatedadministrativedataonhourlywagesfromWashington
state for the case study in Section B.5. This data was provided to us as counts of workers in
(nominal) $0.05 bins between 1992 and 2016 by the state’s Employment Security Department.
We convert this data into $0.25 (real 2016 USD) hourly wage bins for our analysis using
the CPI-U-RS. We also use similar micro-aggregated administrative data from Minnesota
and Oregon for conducting comparison of data quality and measurement error in Online

The CPS outgoing rotation groups are structured so that an individual reports her wage
twice, one year apart, in 4th and 8th sample months. We employ the longitudinal aspect of
the CPS when separately estimating the impacts of the minimum wage on new entrant and
incumbent workers. This requires matching two CPS ﬁles. We exactly follow the procedure
proposed by Madrian and Lefgren (2000), and use household id (HHID), household number
(HHNUM), person line number in household (LINENO), month in sample (MINSAMP), and
month and state variables to match observations in two consecutive CPS ﬁles. We conﬁrm
the validity of matches by evaluating reported sex, race, and age in the two surveys. If sex or
race do not match, or if individual’s age decreases by more than 1 or increases by more than
2, we declare them as “bad matches” and exclude from the matched sample. Additionally,
since matching is not possible from July to December in 1984 and 1985, from January to
84
----------------------------------------

[Page 87 of 116]
September in 1985 and 1986, from June to December in 1994 and 1995, or from January to
August in 1995 and 1996, we exclude these periods. On average, 72% of the observations
in the CPS are matched: around 25% of the individuals in are absent in the 8th sample
month, while an additional 3% are dropped because they are bad matches. We determine
the incumbency of individual from employment status information in the 4th sample month.
Similar to our primary CPS sample, we drop observations with imputed wages in the 8th
sample month. Overall, the number of worker-level observations is smaller in the matched
sample because we only use the 8th sample month in the matched sample, as opposed to
both 4th and 8th sample months in the baseline sample.
Industry classiﬁcations
Following MianandSuﬁ (2014), weuseanindustryclassiﬁcationwithfourcategories(tradable,
non-tradable, construction, and other) based on retail and world trade. According to the
classiﬁcation, an industry is “tradable” if the per worker import plus export value exceeds
$10,000, or if the sum of import and export values of the NAICS 4-digit industry is greater
than $500 million. The retail sector and restaurants compose “non-tradable” industries,
whereas the “construction” industries are industries related to construction, land development
and real estate. Industries that do not ﬁt in either of these three categories are pooled and
labeled as “other”. We merge the CPS with Mian and Suﬁ (2014) industry classiﬁcation using
the IND80 and IND02 variables in the CPS.

Comparison of Administrative Data to CPS
In our event study analysis, we use the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provides
information on wages for a large sample of individuals, after benchmarking to aggregate state-
level employment counts in the QCEW. There is therefore sampling error in our estimated
job counts in each wage bin. In this section we assess the accuracy of CPS based jobs counts
by comparing administrative data on job counts from three states with reliable information
on hourly wages (Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington).
In Section E.1, we compare the performance of the raw CPS and the QCEW-benchmarked
CPS in predicting the counts of workers earning less than $15 in the administrative data from
Minnesota, Oregon and Washington. We show that counts from the QCEW-benchmarked
CPS are much closer to the counts from the administrative data than those from the raw CPS:
the mean squared prediction error is substantially smaller when we use QWEW-benchmarked
CPS data. In Section E.2, we show that the wage distribution from the QCEW-benchmarked
CPS closely matches the distribution from the administrative data from the three states. In
particular, we show that the number of workers reporting earnings under the state minimum
wage is similarly small in both the administrative data and the CPS, which is an important
indication of the degree of misreporting in the CPS. In section E.3we implement structural
estimation to further assess the importance of wage misreporting in the administrative data
and in the QCEW-benchmarked CPS along the lines of Autor, Manning and Smith (2016).
Our estimates show that the implied misreporting is of a similar magnitude in the two data
sources. In section E.4we deconvolve the QCEW-benchmarked CPS using the estimated
measurement error model of Autor, Manning and Smith (2016), and provide estimates using
this measurement-error-corrected frequency distribution.
E.1 Assessing the Accuracy of the Raw versus the QCEW- bench-
marked CPS
We compare the administrative data with the raw CPS, and the QCEW-benchmarked CPS.
Because the CPS is a survey, it has substantially greater sampling error than the QCEW
which is a near-census of all workers in a state. Also, since we are not using observations
with imputed hourly wages in our data sets, state-level employment counts of the raw CPS
data are biased downwards. To address both these problems, our primary sample combines
the CPS wage distribution with state-level employment counts in the QCEW. We label the
data with the QCEW adjustment as the “QCEW-benchmarked CPS”, and the raw CPS as
“CPS-Raw.”42
42We note that the QCEW and CPS have slightly diﬀerent employment concepts. The CPS measures
employment in a reference week while the QCEW measures employment at any time in a quarter. So CPS
employment may be slightly lower than QCEW since some people work only parts of a quarter. Therefore,
the QCEW-benchmarked CPS is closer to the QCEW employment concept. At the same time, any such
gap is likely picked up by the state and time ﬁxed eﬀects. To conﬁrm this, we we implement an event study
regression where the outcome variable is the gap between CPS and QCEW employment. Events are the
same 138 state-level minimum wage changes between 1979-2016 that we use in our benchmark speciﬁcation.
Similar to our benchmark speciﬁcation we include state and time ﬁxed eﬀects in the regression. The blue line

----------------------------------------

[Page 89 of 116]
First, we establish here that QCEW benchmarking of aggregate employment is likely
to improve the accuracy of our counts by wage bin. The employment count for wage bin
w,Ew, can be rewritten as the product of the (discretized) wage density, fw=Prob (w≤
wage<w + 0.25), and the employment , E, soEw=fw×E. The raw CPS-based estimate
for per-capita count is ECPS
w =fCPS
w×ECPS. The QCEW benchmarked CPS uses the
state-level employment counts from the QCEW which has no measurement error given that
includes the near universe of workers; so formally, EQCEW
w =fCPS
w×E. It follows that the
mean squared prediction error ( MSPE) is lower for the QCEW benchmarked CPS than for
the raw CPS, if the measurement errors for fCPS
ware uncorrelated with ECPS. The latter
condition holds if the source of the error is sampling.
Since the bunching approach proposed here mainly focuses on job changes at the bottom
of the wage distribution, we assess whether the raw CPS or the QCEW-benchmarked CPS
does a better job in predicting the number of workers earning less than $15. For each
quartert,we calculate the average per-capita numbers of workers earning less than $15 in
the 20 subsequent quarters (i.e., between tandt+ 20); we also calculate the average for the 4
preceding quarters (i.e., between tandt−4). Then, we subtract the latter from the former
and we refer to this as the transformed counts. The employment changes in Table 1show the
average employment changes in the 20 subsequent quarter after the minimum wage relative
to the 4 preceding quarters. Therefore, the transformed counts are closely related to the
employment estimates shown in Table 1.
In ﬁgure E.1panels (a) and (b), we show the scatterplot of the transformed counts (per
capita) from the administrative data against those from QCEW-benchmarked CPS and the
raw CPS, respectively. In addition to a visual depiction, we also regress the transformed
administrative counts on the transformed CPS-Raw, and QCEW-benchmarked CPS counts.
To assess the accuracy of the data, we use two measures: R2and the slope (ˆβ). A perfect
match between the CPS and the administrative data would yield R2=ˆβ= 1, or a zero
mean-squared prediction error (MSPE). If the CPS correctly predicts the administrative
counts on average, but each prediction possesses some error, then R2<1and ˆβ= 1. On
the other hand, if there is a bias in the CPS counts, then ˆβ/negationslash=1. The QCEW-benchmarked
counts are better predictors of the administrative counts than are the raw CPS counts: for
the former, the estimated slope is 0.778 and the R2is 0.643. In contrast, the raw CPS has a
larger bias ( ˆβ= 0.564) and variance ( R2= 0.322).
In table E.1, we report the ratio of the MSPE using the raw CPS counts to the MSPE
using the QCEW-benchmarked CPS. Besides reporting the MSPE for the transformed count
(the 20 subsequent quarter average minus the 4 preceding quarter average) of workers under
$15, we also report the MSPEs for underlying components. Namely, we calculate the MSPEs
using counts of workers earnings less than $15/hour as well as counts of workers in each $0.25
bins—each averaged over either 4 or 20 quarters. A MSPE ratio above one indicates that the
QCEW-benchmarked CPS performs better in predicting the administrative data than the
raw CPS. The table shows that this is indeed the case: QCEW-benchmarked CPS performs
better in all cases, especially for the aggregated employment counts under $15/hour.
shows the evolution of the gap in the employment rate (relative to the year before the treatment) between
the CPS and QCEW. As Figure E.5shows, there is no systematic change in the gap between CPS-QCEW
employment following treatment.

E.2 Comparison of the Wage Distribution in the CPS and in the
Administrative Data
We assess the sampling and misreporting errors in the CPS by comparing the frequency
distribution of hourly wages in the QCEW benchmarked CPS and in the administrative
data. In Figure E.2we plot 5-year averaged per-capita employment counts in $3 bins relative
to the minimum wage. We compare the distributions at this aggregation level, since our
main estimates on excess and missing jobs in Table 1show 5 year employment changes
in $3 to $5 bins relative to the minimum wage. The red squares show the distribution in
the administrative data while the blue dots show the distribution calculated using QCEW-
adjusted CPS. We report the wage distributions in each each states separately, as well as in
the three states together.
The distributions from the CPS closely match the distributions in the administrative data
in all states and in all three ﬁve-years periods (2000-2004, 2005-2009, and 2010-2014). A
similar number of jobs are present just below the minimum wage in the two data sources,
albeit in some cases there are slightly more in the CPS (e.g. in WA 2005-2009). When
we pool all three states, the CPS and the administrative data exhibit virtually the same
distribution below the minimum wage. Note that in all three of these states, there is no
separate tipped minimum wage, and nearly all workers are covered by the state minimum
wage laws. Therefore, the presence of jobs paying below the minimum wage may reﬂect
misreporting. If this is the case, then Figure E.2suggests that the extent of misreporting is
quite similar in the CPS and in the administrative data. We formally test this in the next
section. At the same time, we should point out that some of the sub-minimum wage jobs may
reﬂect true under-payment. Either way, it is encouraging that the extent of sub-minimum
wage jobs in the CPS is very similar to what is found in high quality administrative wage
data.
The ﬁgures also highlight that the [0,3) bin—which includes workers at and up to $3 above
the minimum wage—contains a somewhat larger number of workers in the administrative
data than in the CPS for Washington state; however, for Oregon and Minnesota, the CPS
closely matches the number of workers in that bin. As a result, when we pool all three states
together, we ﬁnd that the CPS tends to underestimate the number of jobs at and slightly
above the minimum wage. However, this diﬀerence is quite stable over time, as further
shown below in Figure E.3; as a result, our diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence estimates are unlikely to
be aﬀected by this gap between the two counts. Finally, the CPS tends to place slightly
more workers in the middle-income bin ([ MW +$6,MW +$21)), and fewer workers at the
high-income bin ( [MW +$21,∞)).
FigureE.3plots the time paths of the number of jobs below the minimum wage [ MW−
$5,MW ), and jobs at and above the minimum wage ([ MW,MW +$5)relative to the state-
level population from both the administrative data and the CPS. Consistent with the previous
ﬁndings, the job counts below and above in both of the data sets follow very similar paths.
When we pool the data across all three states, the evolution of the jobs below the minimum
wage lines up perfectly across the two series. The level of jobs at and slightly above the
minimum wage is slightly higher in the CPS, but again, the diﬀerences are quite stable over
time. As a result, the diﬀerence-in-diﬀerence estimator implemented in this paper is unlikely
to be aﬀected by the small discrepancy between the administrative and the CPS data.

E.3 Assessment of Misreporting of Wages Using Structural Esti-
mation
To compare the potential measurement error in the CPS and in the administrative data
for these states, we also implement a structural estimation approach developed by Autor,
Manning and Smith (2016). Following Autor, Manning and Smith (2016), we assume that in
the absence of the minimum wage, both the observed and the true latent wage distributions
are log-normal.43A portion ( γ)of the workers report their wages correctly, while others
report it with some error. In the absence of a minimum wage, the observed (log) wage can
be written as
v∗=w∗+D/epsilon1
wherev∗is the observed and w∗is the true latent (log) wage of the worker that would prevail
in the absence of a minimum wage. Dis a binary variable that is equal to 1 when the wage is
misreported, and 0 otherwise. Therefore, P(D= 0) =γmeasures the probability of reporting
wages accurately. When the wage is misreported, the distribution of the (logged) error is
again normal, with /epsilon1∼N(0,1−ρ2
ρ2), whereρ2=cov(v∗,w∗)
var(v∗), reﬂects the correlation between the
observed and true latent distributions. Both parameters ρandγdetermine how misreporting
distorts the observed wage distribution. Here 1−γmeasures the rate of misreporting, while
1−ρ2
ρ2measures the variance of the error conditional on misreporting.
We can summarize the overall importance of misreporting by comparing the standard
deviation of the true latent distribution ( σw)and the observed latent distribution ( σ).When
σw
σ= 1,misreporting does not aﬀect the dispersion in observed wages. But whenσw
σ= 0.5,
say, misreporting causes the observed wage distribution’s standard deviation to be twice as
large that it would if wages were always accurately reported. Autor, Manning and Smith
(2016) notes that the ratio can be approximated by ρandγas follows:
σw
σ=γ+ρ(1−γ)
We estimate the model parameters γandρfor both the administrative data and the CPS.
One additional complication in the administrative data is that sometimes small rounding
errors in hours can shift a portion of workers to the wage bin below the MW; this will tend to
over-state the measurement error in the administrative data (at least in terms of estimating
1−γ).For this reason, we present two sets of estimates. First we keep the data as is by using
wage bins relative to the minimum wage, [MW,MW +$0.15). Second, we additionally show
estimates using re-centered $0.25 wage bins around the minimum wage. The re-centered
$0.25 bin that includes the minimum wage is now deﬁned as [MW−$0.10,MW +$0.15).
The subsequent re-centered bins are deﬁned as [MW +$0.15,MW +$0.40), etc., while the
preceding bins are deﬁned as [MW−$0.35,MW−$0.10), etc.
Our analysis covers the 1990-2015 period for Washington, and the 1998-2015 period for
Minnesota and Oregon: the start dates reﬂect the earliest years the administrative data are
43The latent wage distribution refers to the distribution that would prevail in the absence of a minimum
wage. The wage is called “observed” when it reﬂects both the true value as well as the reporting error.
Note, however, that the “latent observed” wage distribution is only observed in practice in the absence of a
minimum wage.

available for each state. Since none of these three states allow tip credits, we do not drop
tipped workers from our sample, and use all workers in our analysis.
TableE.2reports the misreporting rate (1−γ), the variance of the error term, and the
ratio of the true and observed standard deviations. In panel A, where we re-center the wage
bins, and ﬁnd that the misreporting rate 1−γis slightly smaller in the CPS (.23) than in the
administrative data (0.28).44However, conditional on misreporting, the variance of the errors/parenleftbigg
1−ρ2
ρ2/parenrightbigg
is somewhat larger in the CPS ( 1.46) than in the administrative data (1.25). Putting
these two parts together, we ﬁnd that the ratios of the true to observed standard deviations
σw
σare quite similar in the two datasets: 0.92 in the CPS and 0.91 in the administrative
data. In panel B, where we use un-centered wage bins, the CPS estimates are virtually
unchanged. However, due to the rounding errors in hours in the administrative data, the
estimated misreporting rate (1- γ) increases while the variance of the error conditional on
misreporting/parenleftbigg
1−ρ2
ρ2/parenrightbigg
falls. Overall, the ratio of the true and observed standard deviations
for administrative data in panel B (0.90) remains very similar to those reported in panel A
(0.91) and to the CPS estimates (0.92).
Overall, the structural estimation results suggest that the extent to which there is misre-
porting of wages, they are of similar magnitude in the CPS and in high quality administrative
wage data. This provides additional support for the validity of our bunching estimates using
CPS data.
E.4 Estimates using deconvolved, measurement-error corrected
CPS-ORG
In the previous section, we obtained the functional form of the distribution of misreporting
error (D/epsilon1) in the CPS-ORG. Given an empirical distribution of the observed noisy wage
v=w+D/epsilon1, and an empirical distribution of the error D/epsilon1, we can obtain an estimated
distribution of the the error-free wage, w,using the non-parametric deconvolution procedure
proposed by Comte and Lacour (2011). Given an empirical sample of errors D/epsilon1drawn from
an arbitrary distribution (estimated in the previous section), and the sample of noisy observed
wagesv,theprocedurerecoversameasurementerrorcorrecteddistribution. Thedeconvolution
is based on the insight that the inverse-Fourier transform of the unknown distribution of wis a
function of the estimable characteristic functions of vandD/epsilon1. Estimation is performed using
penalized deconvolution contrasts and data-driven adaptive model-selection, and implemented
using the R package deamer.45
FigureE.4plots the wage distributions of the CPS-ORG and the measurement error
corrected (deconvolved) CPS-ORG (MEC-CPS) in $1 bins relative to the minimum wage
averaged over time and states. We make three observations. First, the share of jobs paying
below the current minimum wage is smaller in CPS-MEC. This is expected, since the Autor,
44The CPS estimate is largely in line with Autor, Manning and Smith (2016) who estimate the misreporting
rate around 20% between 1979 and 2012 using 50 states.
45We separately estimate the distribution of true wages for each state-by-quarter using the same distribution
function for the measurement error. Estimating annual distribution functions for the error following Autor et
al.(2016) produces virtually the same results.
90
----------------------------------------

[Page 93 of 116]
Manning and Smith (2016) approach uses the share below the minimum wage to estimate
the extent of measurement error; so a successful reduction in measurement error should
reduce the share earning below the minimum. Numerically, while 2.67% of the workers report
working below the minimum wage in the CPS, after the measurement error correction it
decreases to 1.57%. Second, the share of workers in the dollar bin of the current minimum
wage are similar in both samples, suggesting that the raw CPS performs relatively well in
reporting the share of workers at or up to $0.99 above the minimum. Third, individuals in
the raw CPS are more likely to report their wages as $17 higher than the current minimum
wage. The CPS-MEC, on the other hand, ﬁnd that there are more individuals with hourly
wages between $1 and $16.99 above the minimum after taking the misreporting error into
account.
In Table E.3, we compare the baseline estimates with those obtained using the deconvolved
data. Column (1) reproduces the baseline estimates reported in Table 1column (1). Column
(2) reports the results using deconvolved data46The missing and excess jobs estimates are
quite similar across columns 1 and 2. The baseline missing jobs estimate of −0.018 (s.e.0.004)
in column 1 is very similar to the measurement error corrected estimate of -0.017(s.e. 0.004) in
column 2. The baseline excess jobs estimates for both columns 1 and 2 are 0.021 (s.e.0.003).
This corroborates our argument that the employment estimates are not substantially aﬀected
by measurement error in reported wages. While the baseline employment elasticity with
respect to the minimum wage is 0.028 (s.e. 0.029) in column 1, it is 0.037 (s.e. 0.031) after
measurement error correction in column 2. The wage eﬀect estimates are also quite similar
when we use the deconvolved data. The baseline percentage change in aﬀected wage is
0.068 (s.e.0.010)in column 1, whereas it is 0.075 (s.e.0.012)in column using deconvolved
data. Overall, these ﬁndings underscore that our results are quite robust to the presence of
misreporting error in wages..
46The deconvolved data uses a slightly diﬀerent sample that excludes the quarters of events due to the
existence of two spikes in those periods. By assumption, the latent wage distribution is log-normal and
observed wage distribution can only have one mass point due to the minimum wage. However, if there is
a minimum wage event in the quarter, then it is likely that observed wage distribution will have two mass
points. In those cases, the deconvolution procedure does not perform well. However, in practice the estimates
including the quarter of events are very similar (results not reported).

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the gap in employment rate between QCEW

have somewhat diﬀerent employment concepts: the CPS asks about employment in a reference week, while
the QCEW measures any employment during the quarter. To alleviate the concern that the diﬀerences in
concepts has an eﬀect on our estimates, we implement an event study regression where the outcome variable
is the gap between CPS and QCEW employment. Events are the same 138 state-level minimum wage changes
between 1979-2016 that we use in our benchmark speciﬁcation. Similar to our benchmark speciﬁcation we
include state and time ﬁxed eﬀects in the regression. The blue line shows the evolution of the gap in the
employment rate (relative to the year before the treatment) between the CPS and QCEW. We also show the
95% conﬁdence interval based on standard errors that are clustered at the state level.

Online Appendix F
Bias in the Classic Two-Way Fixed Eﬀects Panel Regres-
sion with Log Minimum Wage
This Appendix establishes that the classic two-way ﬁxed eﬀects panel regression on log
minimum wage provides biased estimates of the employment eﬀect of the policy. When
implemented over the same time period as our primary speciﬁcation, the two-way ﬁxed eﬀects
estimator with log minimum wage (TWFE-logMW) obtains a large negative estimate for
overall employment changes, in contrast to the small positive and statistically insigniﬁcant
estimate of the employment eﬀect for low-wage workers obtained by the ﬁrst diﬀerence (FD)
speciﬁcation, and the event based speciﬁcations (EB). In the main text, we showed that
the negative employment changes in the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation mainly comes from
the employment changes at the upper tail of the wage distribution, which suggests that the
aggregate employment changes are unlikely to reﬂect the causal eﬀect of minimum wages.
Furthermore, this highlights how understanding the sources of disemployment throughout the
wage distribution can serve as an useful tool for model selection. In this section we document
additional problems with the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation and provide further evidence to
understand the discrepancy between TWFE-logMW and the event study based benchmark
(EB) estimates.
We begin our analysis by assessing the contribution of various factors that drive the
diﬀerences in estimates between our benchmark EB and the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcations.
We establish that the diﬀerences between the two estimates is not driven by using discrete
versus continuous treatment, or any artifact of binning the wages. Table F.1compares the
employment elasticities with respect to the minimum wage of the benchmark EB (see Table 1
and Figure 2) and the TWFE-logMW estimator (Figure 6), as well as several intermediate
forms that bridge the two speciﬁcations. Column 1 reproduces our baseline estimate of the
policy elasticity which considers employment changes locally within a $9 window around the
new minimum wage using the regression speciﬁcation in equation 1. In Column 2 we use the
event study design, but estimate the eﬀect on overall, below $15, and above $15 employment
counts per capita using aggregated state-level treatment variation. The resulting employment
elasticity of 0.027 for the below $15 group is very similar to our baseline employment elasticity.
Reassuringly, we see little employment change for higher wage workers earning above $15.
The resulting overall employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage, 0.016, is
very close to our benchmark estimate. In column 2 we also report results for the 3 Card
and Krueger (CK) probability groups using demographic predictors (see Section 3.1for the
details). Here too, all of the point estimates are small, and in particular there is little change
in employment for those workers predicted to have higher wages. There is also no sizable
disemployment eﬀect for predicted low-wage and and middle-wage groups, which capture
most minimum wage workers,
The EB estimator uses a discrete, binary indicator for minimum wage changes, while the
TWFE-logMW uses continuous treatment. In Column 3 and 4 we provide intermediate results
that continue to use the 8-year event windows, but use a continuous treatment measure. In
particular, we multiply the wage-bin-state-speciﬁc treatment indicators in EB by the change
in log minimum wage; column 3 uses the $9 window around the minimum wage, while column
101

4 simply considers employment under $15, employment above $15, overall employment, and
the three CK groups. This latter EB-logMW speciﬁcation can be written as follows:
Est
Nst=4/summationdisplay
τ=−3βτIτ
st/trianglelogMWs,t−τ +µs+ρt+ust (F.1)
As in our benchmark speciﬁcation, we report the 5 year averages in employment change from
the year prior to treatment:1
5/summationtext4
τ=0βτ−β−1. We ﬁnd that moving from the discrete to
continuous treatment measure has little eﬀect on the estimated employment elasticity.
In contrast, Column 5 estimates a TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation of the following form:
Est
Nst=4/summationdisplay
τ=−2ατlogMWs,t−τ +µs+ρt+ust (F.2)
The cumulative responses can be calculated as βτ=/summationtextτ
j=−3αjby successively summing
the coeﬃcients. Again, we report the 5 year averages in employment change from the year
prior to treatment:1
5/summationtext4
τ=0βτ−β−1.47The TWFE-logMW estimate is the same as what is
reported in Figure 6. The overall employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage
is large, negative, and statistically distinguishable from zero (-0.089., s.e. 0.025). In Figure
F.1we also show the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution by the Card and
Krueger (CK) probability groups. The negative overall eﬀect in the TWFE-logMW model is
concentrated on the “wrong” workers: namely, the large employment change occurs for wage
bins over $15 per hour, and there is a large employment response for only the workers least
demographically likely to be earning near the minimum wage. The TWFE-logMW estimate
is driven entirely by high wage employment or employment likely to be high wage.
The main diﬀerence between equation F.1andF.2is that the EB-logMW focuses on
employment changes within the 8-year event window around the minimum wage changes,
while the TWFE estimates are more sensitive to underlying long-term trends or persistent
shocks to employment, including those that are far away from the actual treatment events.
We additionally estimate a ﬁrst-diﬀerence (FD) speciﬁcation:

τ=0βτ−β−1. This latter speciﬁcation is consistent under the same
strict exogeneity assumptions as the TWFE estimated in levels; however, the small sample
47Because of this normalization, we report the “3rd year or earlier” estimate as −β−1,even though there
are 2 actual leads in the regression. This 3rd lead is analogous to the 5th lag, which refers to estimates the
“5th year or later;” both of these are “binned up” and represent estimates at the end point or outside of the
event window. Since we report estimates for 8 diﬀerent event dates, we refer to this speciﬁcation as having
a 8-year event window. This is slightly diﬀerent from the EB speciﬁcation where the coeﬃcient estimates
are relative to all observations outside of the event window (before and after); this is why a 8-year event
window in that speciﬁcation requires estimating 3 leads and 4 lags. In practice, however, the inclusion of an
additional lead in the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation makes very little diﬀerence.

properties diﬀer substantially when the number of units ( N) is small (Wooldridge, 2010).
Our sample has a relatively small Nwith 51 states and DC, and we have an outcome variable
that is highly persistent (the raw autocorrelation in state EPOP is 0.97; conditional on state
and year ﬁxed eﬀects it is 0.86). This opens up the possibility that small sample biases may
be quite diﬀerent for the TWFE-logMW model estimated in levels than the FD speciﬁcation.
FigureA.10shows that the impact of minimum wages on the wage distribution diﬀers
considerably in the ﬁxed eﬀects and ﬁrst diﬀerence speciﬁcations. Panel (a) and (c) reports
pre-reform eﬀects. We do not expect the minimum wage changes to have an eﬀect on the
wage distribution one year before the minimum wage was increased. This is more or less the
case in the ﬁrst diﬀerence speciﬁcations; however, in the ﬁxed eﬀect speciﬁcations there are
signiﬁcant changes in the wage distribution even before the minimum wage was raised. This
suggests that the ﬁxed eﬀect results are likely to reﬂect pre-existing trends and not the only
the causal eﬀect of the minimum wage. Panels (b) and (d) report the post reform eﬀects.
As we see in the main text, the drop in overall employment in the ﬁxed eﬀect speciﬁcation
is driven by changes in the upper part of the wage distribution. Contrary to that, the ﬁrst
diﬀerence speciﬁcations shows more muted employment responses in the upper tail of the
wage distribution, and there is no indication for signiﬁcant disemployment eﬀects overall.
TableF.2shows the fragility of the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation by using diﬀerent methods
of controlling for long-term trends and persistent shocks to employment confounded with
minimum wage increases. Column 1 reports the EB-logMW speciﬁcation, whose event
window by deﬁnition minimizes the inﬂuence of long-term trends; as a result, the estimated
employment elasticity with respect to the minimum wage is small, 0.008. Column 2 reports
small employment eﬀects using a ﬁrst-diﬀerenced speciﬁcation, which by focusing on higher-
frequency variation reduces the role of long-term trends and persistent shocks.
Columns3through6ofTable F.2reporttheresultsoftheTWFE-logMWspeciﬁcationwith
various control sets. Column 3 repeats for reference the baseline TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation
with no additional controls. Column 4 shows that simply controlling for long-term trends
with state-speciﬁc linear trend terms shrinks the overall employment eﬀect to close to zero.
Column 5 instead adds average major industry and broad occupation shares from 1979-1980
(interacted with time periods) to the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation. These shares account for
shocks to upper tail employment that are predicted by historical industrial/occupational
patterns in the state. The employment estimate in column 5 is also close to zero and not
statistically signiﬁcant.
In column (6), we control for partisan leanings by including a variable that captures
state-level diﬀerences in the presidential vote share of two major party candidates. This
variable accounts for that state-level political leanings might aﬀect both the minimum wage
and employment in ways that are unrelated to each other (Wursten, 2017). In this case, the
partisan voting index decreases the magnitude of the overall employment estimate by 70%,
from -0.089 in column (3) to -0.027 in column (6). Overall, Table F.1highlights the fragility
of the two-way ﬁxed estimate suggesting a large overall employment eﬀect. Allowing for
richer controls for time-varying heterogeneity produces results that are very similar to the
baseline estimates.
FigureF.3panel (a) shows another problem with the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation. This
ﬁgure plots the time path of employment elasticities with respect to the minimum wage
for the TWFE-logMW. Since increases in nominal minimum wages, log(MW ), are always
103
----------------------------------------

[Page 106 of 116]
permanent, the last lag in the distributed lag model reﬂects the “long term eﬀect” - the
weighted average of eﬀect at or after 4 years following a minimum wage increase. Moreover,
since we normalize the estimates relative to the one year before the minimum wage, −α−1
measures the average employment occurring at 3 (or more) years prior to the minimum wage
increase. The time path of the estimates shows that the TWFE-logMW estimator obtains a
spurious, positive leading eﬀect three (or more) years prior to the minimum wage increase.
This shows that there were large employment reductions substantially prior to minimum wage
increases, which can impart a bias on the treatment eﬀect estimated using the TWFE-logMW
model; moreover, because we are “binning up” the leads and lags at -3 and +4, respectively,
biases associated with these binned estimates can impart a bias on the estimated leads and
lags, producing a spurious dynamic pattern even within the event window. These sizable
and statistically signiﬁcant pre-treatment and post-treatment eﬀects disappear once we add
state-speciﬁc linear trends (see panel b).
FigureF.4plots the time path of the employment elasticities separately for workers
earning below $15 per hour (panel a) and above $15 per hour (panel b). The pattern of
positive leads and the overall downward trend in employment preceding the minimum wage
change comes from workers earning above $15 per hour. Lower wage workers, earning under
$15/ hour, see little change in employment before or after the minimum wage increase.
Finally, and importantly, Table F.3provides a evidence that demonstrates that the
disemployment detected by the TWFE-logMW estimator is not caused by the minimum wage
changes, but rather is driven entirely by employment shocks in the 1980’s (much earlier than
the minimum wage changes). Column 1 uses the entire 1979-2016 period and shows the overall
employment elasticities with respect to the minimum wage from the classic ﬁrst diﬀerence
estimator (panel A), and ﬁrst-diﬀerenced version (panel B). Panel C reports estimates from
our events-based approach. As before, the TWFE-logMW estimator stands out in estimating
a large, statistically signiﬁcant overall employment decline due to minimum wage changes, in
contrast to the ﬁrst-diﬀerence. However, when we restrict the sample to the 1993-2016 period,
the TWFE-logMW estimates become small and stastitically indistinguishable from zero,
and are quite similar to the ﬁrst-diﬀerence and event-based estimates. This is noteworthy
because there were few state minimum wage changes prior to 1993. At the same time, we
note that our event based estimates are highly robust to the choice of sample (panel C), as
are estimates using the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced speciﬁcation (panel B).
Falsiﬁcation test. We also perform a falsiﬁcation exercise to demonstrate the bias in
the TWFE-logMW estimates using the 1979-2016 sample. As the ﬁrst step of the falsiﬁcation
exercise, column 3 shows results using the full 1979-2016 sample of data, but excluding
the ten states that experienced any minimum wage increases prior to 1993. The pattern
of results remains the same in column 3, with the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation estimating
large employment declines due to the minimum wage. In columns 4 and 5, we decompose
the estimate in column 3. In column 4, we use actual employment data until 1992 for the
forty states that did not have any minimum wage event 1979-1992. For 1993-2016, we set
employment outcomes to exactly 0 in all states. Because there were no minimum wage events
prior to 1993 in this sample, and because the employment outcomes are exactly constant
after 1993, the causal employment eﬀect should be zero. Yet, column 4 shows that the
TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation still estimates a sizable negative employment eﬀect, in contrast
104
----------------------------------------

[Page 107 of 116]
to the ﬁrst-diﬀerenced and event-based speciﬁcations. Put diﬀerently, minimum wage events
in 1993 and onwards appears to aﬀect employment changes in 1979-1992. Column 5 does
the opposite, and replaces all employment outcomes before 1993 with 0, and uses the actual
employment rate in 1993-2016. In this case, variations in the variable of interest and the
dependent variable take place in the same time period, and both the TWFE-logMW and the
FD speciﬁcations indicate no disemployment eﬀect. Finally, in column 6 we show that the
spurious negative results in column 4 are not due to anticipation eﬀects: here we consider
states without minimum wage events prior to 1996 (instead of 1993 as in column 4); this
reduces the sample to 39 instead of 40 states but the results are similar. Finally, in contrast
to the TWFE-logMW case (panel A), our EB estimates (panel C) easily pass this falsiﬁcation
test.
To summarize, our falsiﬁcation test shows that estimated disemployment in the TWFE-
logMW speciﬁcation is entirely due to employment shocks in the 1980s that were correlated
with future minimum wage increases decades later, thereby aﬀecting the estimation of the
state ﬁxed eﬀects. This is why the restriction to an explicit event window as in the EB
speciﬁcation guards against the bias aﬄicting the TWFE-logMW speciﬁcation. This is
also why the inclusion of state trends or controls for historical industry/occupation shares
interacted with periods substantially reduces the likely bias in that speciﬁcation.
The Partisan Tilt of the 1990-1991 Recession and the Confounder
Why are state-level employment rates in 1979-1992 are correlated with minimum wage events
in post-1996? To understand what drives this correlation we plot the time paths of the
minimum wage (Panel (a)) and employment rates (Panel (b)) of the low and high minimum
wage states in Figure F.5. The 15 states where the federal minimum wage laws applies during
1996-2016 are classiﬁed as low minimum wage states, and the remaining 36 states as high
minimum wage states. Figure F.5shows that the employment rate of the latter states are
elevated relative to the former between the mid-1980s and the early 1990s, even as the level of
minimum wages were almost the same across the two set of states in this period. The elevated
employment level in the mid-1980s aﬀects the estimation of the state ﬁxed eﬀects in the
TWFE-logMW model covering 1979-2016. However, the divergence between low minimum
wage and high minimum wage states ended quickly by 1990-1991 recession. Since then the
employment rates follow parallel trends, even though there is a clear divergence in the level
of the minimum wage between low and high minimum wage states in the 2000’s. The timing
of divergence between high and low minimum wage states highlights that the bias in the
TWFE-logMW estimates is related to the diﬀerential impact of the 1990-1991 recession on
(future) low and high minimum wage states.
Why is the drop in employment in the 1990-1991 recession related to future minimum
wage changes in the 2000s? It is possible that the 1990-1991 recession was so severe in some
states that it changed the political landscape and opened up the door for parties supporting
minimum wages. Another explanations could be that 1990-1991 recession happened to be
more pronounced for Democratic-leaning states—states that would also be more inclined to
raise the minimum wage in the early 2000s following a long period of federal inaction. Table
??aims to test the empirical relevance of these explanations by examining the determinants
of having a state-level minimum wage higher than the federal level in the post-1996s using a
105

linear probability model. Column (1) shows that states that are harder hit by the 1990-1991
recession are more likely to have a state-level minimum wage after 1996, conﬁrming our
previous observation about Figure F.5. The model reports that for each percentage point
decline in employment rate in 1990-1991, the probability of a state to be a high minimum wage
state increases by 4.2% (s.e. 1.3%). However, including political leanings variables in columns
(2) and (3) substantially decrease the estimate and renders it statistically indistinguishable
from zero. In column (2), the unionization rate in the 1980s variable substantially decreases
the size of the 1990s shock estimate and renders it statistically insigniﬁcant. In column (3),
we include the average of the Partisan Voting Index (PVI) in 2000s. The PVI shows the
shows the diﬀerence between Republican Party and Democratic Party candidates’ vote shares
in the state. To address potential concerns related to long-run eﬀects of the recession on
political leanings, we instrument the average PVI in the 2000s with that of the 1988. In this
case, the coeﬃcient of the severity of the recession has changed its sign, become negative and
statistically insigniﬁcant. This suggests that the severity of the 1990-1991 recession did not
have a causal impact on future state-level minimum wage changes.
Overall, these ﬁndings clarify that the large, negative TWFE-logMW estimate is driven
by upper tail shocks in the 1980s—substantially prior to most minimum wage increases we
study. Moreover, these shocks are predicted by a state’s historical industrial/occupational
structure. Importantly, these shocks died out substantially prior to most minimum wage
changes we study: indeed, as we have shown, these shocks do not produce any pre-existing
trends or upper tail employment changes within the 8-year window used in our event-based
analysis. However, they do substantially bias the TWFE-logMW estimator that is sensitive
to underlying long-term trends or persistent shocks occurring many years before the actual
treatment events.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the eﬀect of the minimum wage on the wage distribution of the three Card and Kruger probability
groups in ﬁxed eﬀects speciﬁcation (TWFE-logMW). All panels estimate the regression on the contemporaneous log minimum
wage, as well as on 4 annual lags and 2 annual leads. For each wage bin we run a separate regression, where the outcome
is the number of jobs per capita in that state-wage bin. The cumulative response for each event date 0, 1,...,4 is formed by
successively adding the coeﬃcients for the contemporaneous and lagged log minimum wages. The green histogram bars show
the mean of these cumulative responses for event dates 0, 1,...,4, divided by the sample average employment-to-population rate
—and represents the average elasticity of employment in each wage bin with respect to the minimum wage in the post-treatment
period. The 95% conﬁdence intervals around the point estimates are calculated using clustered standard errors at the state level.
The dashed purple line plots the running sum of the employment eﬀects of the minimum wage up until the particular wage
bin. The rightmost purple bar in each of the graphs decomposes the post-averaged elasticity of the overall state employment-
to-population with respect to minimum wage by the groups, where the latter is obtained from the regressions where outcome
variable is the state level employment-to-population rate. All regressions are weighted by the sample average state population.

Notes: The ﬁgure shows the three year the pre reform (panel a and c) and post reform eﬀects (panel b and d) of the minimum
wage hikes on the wage distribution in ﬁxed eﬀects (TWFE-logMW) and ﬁrst diﬀerence (FD) speciﬁcations. Panels (a) and (b)
estimate two-way (state-bin and year) ﬁxed eﬀects regressions on contemporaneous as well as 2 annual leads, and 4 annual lags
of log minimum wage. In Panels (c) and (d) we employ ﬁrst diﬀerence regressions on contemporaneous as well as 2 annual leads,
and 4 annual lags of the log change in the minimum wage. For each wage bin we run a separate regression, where the outcome
is the number of jobs per capita in that state-wage bin. The pre reform eﬀect is formed by adding the ﬁrst and the second
leading coeﬃcients and multiplying the sum by -1: when the cumulative response at τ=−1is normalized to 0, this represents
the three year leading eﬀect relative to the date −1.For the ﬁxed eﬀects speciﬁcation (panel a), the three year leading eﬀect
estimate represents three or more years prior to treatment; for the ﬁrst diﬀerence speciﬁcation (panel c), this estimate represents
exactly three years prior to treatment. The cumulative response for each event date 0, 1, ..., 4 is formed by successively adding
the coeﬃcients for the contemporaneous and lagged terms. The green bars show the post reform eﬀects calculated by the mean
of these cumulative responses for event dates 0, 1, ..., 4, divided by the sample average employment-to-population rate —and
represents the average elasticity of employment in each wage bin with respect to the minimum wage in the post-treatment
period. (panel (b) is the same as Figure 6in the main text). The 95% conﬁdence intervals around the point estimates are
calculated using clustered standard errors at the state level. The dashed purple line plots the running sum of the employment
eﬀects of the minimum wage up until the particular wage bin. The rightmost purple bar in each of the graphs is the elasticity
of the overall state employment-to-population rate with respect to minimum wage. In the bottom left corner we also report the
point estimate on this elasticity with standard errors that are clustered at the state level. Regressions are weighted by state
population.

THE CORRELATION: MINIM UM WAGE – UNEMPLOYMENT IN 
THE CONDITIONS OF TRANSITION TO DIGITAL ECONOMY   
 
1. Introduction  
The adoption of the Directive on adequate minimum wages in EU in 2022 raised many 
challenges to the EU member -states (European Commission, 2022).  The main challenge , 
which they need to face  is to comply the level of their  minimum wage s with the average 
wage levels  and median wage  levels , which fact is based on the  formulation of the Kaitz 
index. In the EU member -states, which are in a process of incomes convergence with the 
average values for EU and those which are still not Eurozone member -states, this fac t will 
lead to a pressure  on governments  to increase  the minimum wage  levels . Countries, like 
Bulgaria and Romania could have some difficulties in the process of implementation of the 
Directive and this could negatively affect the unemployment rate in thes e member -states.  
On next place , the transition to digital economy is increasingly reducing the productiveness 
of low -skilled labor. In this way, the administrative increase of the minimum wage  levels  in 
accordance with the  provisions of the  Directive will force employers to replace low -skilled 
personnel with machines and software.  
Balsmeier and Woerter (2019) focus their research on the attitude of private companies to 
make investments in digitalization of their economic activities and to e valuate how these 
processes influence the employment rate. They have done their empirical analysis based on 
a representative survey amongst Swiss companies. The authors have concluded that the 
investments in information and communication technologies deplo yment in  the economic 
activities of companies, have positive effect on the employment of high -skilled workers and 
respectively  a negative impact on the employment of workers who are low -qualified. In this 
regard, they present  a set of measures that nationa l governments need to consider  when 
preparing  their social policies. First, the competitiveness of technologically advanced 
countries will depend on the number of high -skilled workers employed, especially in the 
production sectors of the national economies . This in turns,  will require a  flexible labor 
market, which will easily adapt to the achievements of the science and technology. Second, 
the life -long improvement of professional skills of workers is of utmost significance so as  
to be achieved a synchron ization  between the required qualification for occupying the 
relevant profession and the knowledge and skill s that workers need to have.

2 Another team of authors  (Borsova, et. al, 2020) examines two hypothesis, concerning the 
influence of digitalization on the labor market development. According to the first 
hypothesis, a clear negative correlation between economic processes digitalization and 
increase of unemployment rate has not been es tablished yet. They believe that this process 
will be smoothly happening in the medium -run and the long -run, and the labor market will 
adapt to the emergence of brand -new professions and to the disappearance of existing ones. 
In accordance with the second hypothesis, the authors have studied how susceptible are 
jobs to computerization. In this regard, they have proved that there is a real risk of 
approximately 50 % of jobs in the USA to be replaced with information and communication 
technologies  (computers , algorithms,  and robots ) in the next two decades . 
The p ublication of Szabó -Szentgróti,  Vagvari and Varga (2021) evaluates the positive and 
negative effects of Industry 4.0 on the development of the labor market.  To the positive 
aspects of digitalization, th ey refer increase of labor productiveness and competitiveness of 
enterprises; higher quality of the products and services provided; low amount of the 
variable costs etc. The negative aspects of digitalization on the labor market, they relate to 
the increas ed rate of the structural unemployment ; deepening of inequalities amongst the 
various groups; lack of qualified personnel; loss of approximately 800 million of jobs till 
2030; slowdown in the global economic growth ; change in the educational methods and 
acquisition of professional qualification and skills amongst the population.  
The purpose of the present research is to identify the direction and strength of correlation 
between changes in minimum wage levels and unemployment rate in the context of 
conflicti ng findings in the scientific literature. An important research question here is 
whether the business cycle phases influence this process in the conditions of transition to 
digital economy. In this regard, the present publication contributes to the develop ment of 
the scientific literature by providing empirical evidence for the opportunities the provisions 
of the Directive on adequate minimum wages in EU to be implemented in EU member -
states with the lowest households’  incomes  in the European Union .   
2. Theoretical background   
The Nobel prize for economics 2021 of David Card, Joshua Angrist and Guido Imbens 
raised more questions than answers . The dominant theoretical understanding  of the late 20th 
century that the increase of minimum wage  levels  leads to decrease of employment rate 
because of higher production costs was challenged. Card and Krueger (2000) argue that 
such a negative correlation does not necessarily occur.  Several statements deserve attention 
in their publication :  
First, the increase of minimum wage  levels  manifests its effects over time. This could be 
done in administrative way in a period of economic upswing, and the administrative act 
through which the minimum w age is increased , could enter into force in a period of 
economic recession. Consequently, there is a time lag due to the administrative procedures. 
This creates difficulties for evaluating the labor market reactions to the changes in the 
minimum wage level s.  
----------------------------------------

[Page 3 of 11]
3 Second , the increase in the minimum wage levels probably leads to increase in the final 
products prices in the respective economic sector. Thus, the negative effects of this increase 
are borne not by the workers, but by the consumers. This process is o bserved even in 
economic sectors with perfect competition, like fast food restaurants.   
There exist publications by other authors who have examined the negative correlation 
between increase of minimum wage levels and the employment rate.  
Chong -Uk-Kim and Gieyoung Lim (2018), have made an empirical analysis of  25 OECD 
member -states.  The authors concluded that companies could hire skilled or unskilled 
personnel so as to maximize their profit , where setting a higher minimum wage levels leads 
to a decreas e in labor demand but does not lead to changes in the labor supply. According 
to the empirical data presented, it is obvious that “the modest” increase of minimum wage 
levels has a limited influence on the employment rate. For example, with a 10% increase in 
the minimum wage level, the employment rate decreases by 0,7%.  
The effects of changes in the minimum wage levels on the regional employment and 
unemployment are studied in the case of strong market economies, such as Germany. In the 
publication of Bonin  et al. (2019) the effects of introducing statutory minimum wage since 
2015 on the employment and unemployment rates at regional labor markets in the short run 
and the medium run are identified. The authors have summarized that the adoption of such 
type of  minimum wage in Germany leads to a significant reduction in the marginal 
employment rates during the first years of implementing this reform. According to the 
authors, there is no evidence that the minimum wage level causes significant decrease in the 
employment rate.  
Alison Wellington (1991) has studied what the effects of minimum wage levels on youth 
employment are . According to him, approximately 21% of the population in the ages 
between 20 -24 years earn minimum wage in the USA.  While studying the correlation 
between the abovementioned variables, the author has accounted the effects of teenage 
education without cons idering the seasonal components, which influence the youth 
employment rate. In the conclusions, he has summarized that there is no significant 
evidence that the increase of minimum wage level s will have any strong effect on the youth 
employment rate . 
The i ssue, concerning the influence of minimum wage levels is studied also by Yih-chyi 
Chuang (2006). The author identifies the influence of minimum wage levels on the number 
of employed/unemployed youngsters in accordance with the adoption of new economic 
policies for minimum wage levels  regulation  in Taiwan. The author applies an empirical 
model which take s into consideration not only the influence of minimum wage levels on 
youth employment rate, but  also the factors, that influence the labor supply and demand , as 
well as  the components accounting seasonality and regional differences. For measuring the 
minimum wage level, Chuang uses Kaitz index . The conclusions of the author are that in 
the short run the introduction of minimum wage amongst youngsters leads to  higher 
employment rates and does not have a reverse effect on the youth unemployment rate. In 
the long run, however, the youth employment rate will depend on the higher labor supply 
by them. In this case, the effect on achieving long -term economic growth will be a negative 
value , as the accumulation of human capital will be slowed down .

4 Maloney (2009) has studied the correlation between minimum wage levels amongst 
youngsters and the unemployment rate in New Zealand. According to him, the participation 
of labor force in the labor market depends both on the wage levels and possibilities of 
ensuring employ ment. The author is searching for the answer to the question “is there any 
evidence that employers tend to substitute low -paid youngsters for high -paid adults  in the 
conditions of increasing minimum wage levels?” As a result of the empirical analysis , 
Malo ney (2009) has found a direct effect of minimum wage levels on the development of 
the labor market in New Zealand, where this labor market is fully centralized. Taking into 
account,  the seasonality, the effects of the business cycles and other external fac tors, the 
author by means of time series has understand that 10% increase in the minimum wage 
levels leads to  a decrease in the youth employment rate by 3,5%. When considering  the lack 
of sufficient qualifying skills amongst youngsters, this percentage increases to 5,7. Maloney 
(2009) has also inferred the indirect effects of the change s in the minimum wage levels and 
according to him teenagers who do not earn the same minimum wage levels as adults , are 
“close substitutes” to young adults at t he labor market. In this way the increase in the 
minimum wage levels has a reverse effect on the teenager’s  employment rate. 
Gavrel, Lebon and Rebiere (2010) evaluate the short -term and long -term influence of 
minimum wage levels on the unemployment rate in  terms of recruitment and vacancy 
management policies in companies. As a result of the econometric analysis applied, the 
authors conclude that the introduction of minimum wage levels favors employment rate, 
but this not always means effective functioning o f the labor market. They summarize that 
when the workers employment in the low -skilled economic sectors is increased, this will 
lead to an increase in the overall unemployment rate.  
This topic is also studied by Bulgarian authors, such as : Tsanov, Shopov, Beleva, 
Hristoskov, (2017) , Beleva, (2017)  and others . 
 
3. Study area, data,  and methods  
The scope of the study is focused on EU member -states, which are in a process of income 
convergence with the EU average values and those which are not Eurozone member -states 
yet. The representative survey is done for Bulgaria, which is an EU member -state since 
2007.  
For the purposes of the present analysis, there will be used the following data : statistical 
information from international databases such as EUROSTAT and World Bank database. 
The missing information about the period before Bulgarian membership to the EU, is taken 
from the database of Bulgarian National Statistical Institute. The avail able data for this 
period, which is presented in BGN is converted into USD or euros.  
The empirical research is done by applying regression analysis through the statistical 
software STATA. The chosen 30 -years period for the analysis (1991 -2021)  coincide s with 
the time when Bulgaria is a market economy.

Before running the linear regression, we will first establish a scatterplot of the minimum 
wage  levels  versus unemployment rate in order to  visualize the relationship between these 
variables and to check for obvious deviations.

The result s achieved show that in a 30 -year statistical series (1991 -2021) – the linear 
regression has five periods : 1991 -1995, 1996 -2002, 2003-2007, 2008 -2013, 2014 -2021. 
These periods absolutely coincide with the  real phases of the  business cycles of the 
Bulgarian economy. It is a well -known fact that the world economic and financial crisis, 
which started in 2007 -2008  affected negatively also the Bulgarian economy, which  fact is 
also reflected in the statistical data, available in the EUROSTAT and World Bank 
databases.   
On figure 1, one can see that in the period 2008 -2013 , there is a clear reverse trend : the 
increase in the minimum wage levels has led to an increase in the unemployment rate. The 
other similar trend, which is observed, is in the time 1996 -2002, which is related to a period 
of crisis for the development of the Bulgarian economy.  
Consequently, in a phase  of recession or crisis of the business cycle of Bulgarian economy, 
an increase in the minimum wage levels leads to an increase in the unemployment rate of 
the country .

6 This fact provokes an interest to the authors to study the correlation between 
unemployment rate and minimum wage levels for the period 2008 -2013.  This decline phase 
of the business cycle is most clearly expressed in the scatterplot.  
In this way we could use the Pearson’s correlation coefficient to define the linear 
correlation between these variables. The results show that the correlation between  these  
variables is very strong and positive and there is a proportionate relationship between them.

This strong correlation between the variables allows the regression ana lysis to be 
proceeded. Let’s check the correlation between the variables through the linear regression 
model for the period 2008 -2013,  through the STATA software. :

The explanatory power of the R2 model is approximately 80% (79,5%).  
This means that during the chosen period, 80% of the changes in the unemployment rate 
could be explained by the changes in the minimum wage levels.  
Coef. ( MinWage ) is +0,071244. This shows that the average changes in the response 
variable are associated with  one-unit increase in the explanatory variable. In this case, each 
increase in the minimum wage levels is associated to an increase of the unemployment rate 
with an average value of +0,071244.  
This data will be used so as to  be formulated a regression equa tion, which represents the 
positive correlation between the minimum wage levels and the unemployment rate for the 
studied period.  
The regression equation is the following : 
Unemployment rate  = -8.347174 + 0.071244* Minimum wage levels  + ε               (1)  
After making the necessary replacements in the regression equation, it could be concluded 
the following: if the government increases the minimum wage level with 50 BGN and the 
determination coefficient is taken into consideration, it  could be accepted that in a period of 
economic crisis, the increase in the minimum wage levels will lead to an increase in the 
unemployment rate by 6%. Since the unemployment rate depends on various factors, here it 
is important the direction of the corre lation between the studied variables, which is a 
positive one, especially in a period of economic crisis , which is also proved by the derived 
regression equation.  
Now, it is necessary the reliability of the analysis to be checked. : 
The Significance  F is < 0.05 and equals  0.0169.  
RMSE=1.3404. This is the root mean square error . SI= 0.13. These values are acceptable 
because when we use yearly data the value  of SI needs to be under  30%, which is a reliable 
value as the explanatory power of R2 is over  0.75.  
P>|t|. As this value is  < 0,05 (0.017), we could conclude that there is a statistically 
significant correlation between the minimum wage levels and the unemployment rate.  
Based on the abovementioned, it could be assumed that the model used is reliable.  
In order the abovementioned results to be verified, another control analyzes are done : 
1. Regression analysis of the correlation minimum wage levels and the absolute value of 
unemployment for the studied period . 
2. Regression analysis of the correlation between average monthly insurance income s and 
unemployment rate for the studied period.  
----------------------------------------

[Page 8 of 11]
8 3. Regression analysis of the correlation between the absolute volume of employment in 
the private sector and the minimum wage levels for the studied period .  
The control analyzes have proved the credibility  of the model.  
 
5. Conclusion  
As a result of the conducted regression analysis for the evaluation of changes in minimum 
wage levels on the unemployment rate for a 30 -year period (1991  – 2021) for Bulgaria, the 
following conclusions could be made : 
During a phase of economic downturn or recession of the business cycle of the Bulgarian 
economy, an increase in the minimum wage levels will lead to an increase in the 
unemployment rate. The regression analysis has an explanatory power of 80% which means 
that it is credible.  This result could be perceived as a contradiction to the findings of Card 
and Krueger (2000). Probably these contradictions  could be explained by the different 
structures of the USA economy and the national economies of the new EU membe r-states, 
like Bulgaria and Romania.  
Another conclusion of the analysis is that the adoption of the Directive on adequate 
minimum wages in EU should not need to be associated with an administrative annual 
increase in the minimum wage levels, based on the Kaitz index. In this way, the phases of 
the business cycle will not be considered. The minimum wage levels should only be 
increased in phases of upswing and high economic growth rates of the business cycle of the 
national economies. An d vice versa, in the phases of downturn and recession of the 
business cycle, every  increase of the minimum wage levels should be limited.  
In addition, it is obvious that in the process of transition to digital economy , it is very 
difficult to be measured t he low -skilled workers ’ productiveness. In this way, the 
administrative increase of the minimum wage levels, which is not assigned with the 
business cycle phases, will force employers to replace human resources with machines and 
software. This fact will se riously affect the implementation of the national income polic ies 
by the government s.

Abstract : The research is done in the context of the upcoming introduction of new 
European legislation for the first time for regulation of minim um wage at European 
level. Its purpose is to identify the direction and strength of the correlation amongst 
changes of minim um wage and unemployment  rate in the context of conflicting 
findings  of the scientific literature. There will be used statistical instruments  for the 
purposes of the analysis as it incorporates data for Bulgaria for the period 1991 -
2021. The significance of the research is related to the transition to digital economy 
and the necessity for complex transformation of the minim um wage functions in th e 
context of the new socio -economic reality.

I estimate the effect of the minimum wage on formal wages, informal wages, and employment in
Colombia. I exploit an unexpected increase in the real minimum wage during 1999. My analysis combi-nes unconditional quantile regressions with a differences-in-differences design. I ﬁnd evidence of wage
responses for wages close to the minimum wage. The increases are present in both the informal and for-
mal sectors, and are larger in the formal one. Wages around the minimum increase by around 3 percent inthe formal sector for a 10 percentage points larger minimum wage incidence, and by around 1 percent in
the informal sector. These increases are smaller than those implied by full compliance to minimum wage
policy, but positive for some unaffected workers. This suggests employers partially comply with the min-imum wage and use it as a reference. I ﬁnd slight negative employment effects on the informal sector, but
not on the formal sector. The effects in the informal sector are not driven by cross-sectoral effects. The
results suggest the minimum wage has a direct impact on the informal labor market, although theymay not apply to minimum wage changes in other countries or contexts, or to larger minimum wageincreases.

The minimum wage is a common policy in developed and
developing countries. Most of the literature about the impact of
the minimum wage focuses on the effects on formal labor marketswith regulatory compliance. A related literature studies the effects
of the minimum wage on informal labor markets, where labor reg-
ulations are unlikely to be binding.
The labor economics literature for developing countries shows
that the wage distribution of informal workers has a mode at the
minimum wage. For formal markets in developing countries, the
literature suggests the minimum wage affects the lower tail of
the wage distribution. There is less evidence about how the mini-
mum wage impacts the distribution of informal wages, beyond the
mode of the wage distribution. It may have a direct impact on the
informal market by inﬂuencing informal labor contracts. It may
also have an indirect impact, through interactions with the formal
sector. Formal and informal labor markets may be connected, giv-
ing rise to cross-sectoral effects. For example, formal workers may
buy goods and services provided by informal workers.
In this paper, I estimate the effect of the minimum wage on
the distribution of wages. I do this for formal and informal labormarkets in Colombia. Several characteristics of Colombia make it
an interesting setting to seek an answer to this question. First, it
has high minimum wages relative to similar countries in LatinAmerica. Second, historically it has had a large informal sector.
Deﬁning informal workers as those that do not have access to
employee health insurance, informal workers accounted for about
half of employment in 2000 ( Mondragón-Vélez et al., 2010 ).
Third, during the 90s, the minimum wage was indexed to
expected inﬂation. I exploit an inﬂation forecast error in 1999,
which produced a large unexpected real minimum wage increase.
Colombian authorities increased the national minimum wage by
16 percent by the end of 1998. This minimum wage increase
was equal to expected inﬂation in 1999. However, because of a
crisis, actual inﬂation was below expected, and the real minimum
wage had a steep increase.
Fig. 1 shows the wage density for the formal and informal sec-
tors before and after the minimum wage shock. Visual evidence
suggests that both sectors react to the shock. The density shifts
around the percentiles near the minimum wage. I estimate the
effect of this unexpected shock on the marginal distributions of
formal and informal wages. I also address direct and cross-
sectoral effects on the informal sector. I do this in three steps. First,
I measure the incidence of the minimum wage across different
city-industry blocks in both sectors, using the fraction of workers

affected by the increase. These are workers whose real wage is in
between the old and the new minimum wage before it changes.
Second, I compare wage distributions between city-industry
blocks with different incidence. To estimate the effect on these
wage distributions, I use an unconditional quantile regression
method ( Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux 2009 ), and exploit the real
minimum wage shock using a differences-in-differences design.
Unconditional quantile regressions estimate the impact on the
marginal distributions depicted in Fig. 1 directly, as opposed to
estimating the effects on the conditional distribution of wages
through conditional quantile regression, or on mean wages
through linear regression. The method involves estimation of a lin-
ear regression of a re-centered inﬂuence function (RIF) for the
unconditional quantiles on the explanatory variables.
A major challenge to identify the effects of the minimum wage
in this context is the concurrence of the ﬁnancial crisis and the
minimum wage shock. Estimating the minimum wage effect by
comparing city-industry blocks rests on a key identifying assump-tion: city-industry blocks with different minimum wage incidence
should be differentially affected by the minimum wage shock, and
not differentially affected by the crisis. Time-varying labor market
differences between cities and industries may invalidate the
design. I address this concern by controlling for city-speciﬁc
trends, local labor demand shocks, and local ﬁnancial sector GDP.
In the third part of the paper, I test for cross-sectoral effects
from the formal to the informal sector. I do this by looking at the
effect of the formal sector minimum wage incidence on informal
wages.This paper contributes to the literature estimating the distribu-
tional effects of minimum wages. In the U.S., these studies have fol-
lowed different approaches, like decompositions ( DiNardo, Fortin,
& Lemieux, 1996 ), quantile regressions ( Autor, Manning, & Smith,
2016; Lee, 1999 ), and panel data studies ( Neumark, Schweitzer,
& Wascher, 2004 ). There are several theoretical explanations for
effects on the entire wage distribution. Substitution from low
skilled to high skilled labor could lead to wage gains for workers
earning above the minimum. If the minimum wage is used as a ref-
erence value, then its increase can lead to a shift in the whole
distribution.
There are also several papers estimating distributive minimum
wage effects in developing countries and in economies with large
informal sectors in Latin America. For Brazil, Fajnzylber (2001)
and Lemos (2009) provide evidence of responses of wage distribu-
tions to the minimum wage in both sectors. Khamis (2013) ﬁnds
larger impacts of increases in the minimum wage in the informal
sector when compared to the formal one. Engbom and Moser
(2018) argue that higher minimum wages led to compression of
the wage distribution. For Costa Rica, El-Hamidi and Terrell
(2002) ﬁnd that the minimum wage reduced inequality and
increased employment in the formal sector. Gindling and Terrell
(2005) argue that the minimum wage reduced formal and informal
wage differentials, despite low enforcement. Gindling and Terrell
(2007) ﬁnd small negative employment effects in the formal sector,
but not in the informal one. For Ecuador, Wong (2019) ﬁnds that
wages and hours worked increased for low-wage workers after a
minimum wage increase. For Honduras, Ham (2018) ﬁnds that,

due to a minimum wage increase, formal labor falls and wages rise,
while the opposite happens in the informal sector. For Mexico,
Bosch and Manacorda (2010) ﬁnd reductions in inequality attribu-
ted to minimum wage increases, and Campos, Esquivel, and
Santillán (2017) ﬁnd some impact of a regional minimum wage
uniﬁcation on formal wages. Bouchot (2018) ﬁnds evidence of
increases along the whole wage distribution after a minimum
wage increase. For Uruguay, Borraz and González-Pampillón
(2017) ﬁnd formal wage inequality reductions from a large
increase in the minimum wage, but also negative employment
effects.1
Relative to these previous studies, this paper makes several con-
tributions. First, it uses a novel identiﬁcation strategy coming from
an unexpected shock in the real minimum wage as a source of
identifying variation. This contrasts with previous literature thatuses expected increases in nominal wages. Second, apart from
the focus on the response in the formal and informal sectors, I
explicitly test for cross-sectoral effects from the formal into the
informal sector. In a competitive and segmented labor market
model ( Harris & Todaro, 1970 ) a rise in the minimum wage would
raise covered sector wages above the competitive level for workers
in the lower part of the covered sector wage distribution. Some of
these workers would be dismissed, and would go to the uncovered
sector at wages below the new minimum wage. The additional
labor supply in the uncovered sector would indirectly decrease
wages. Effects in both sectors could also happen because of capital
relocation into the informal sector. This would increase the mar-
ginal productivity of labor. The wage increase in the covered sector
could also raise the demands for goods produced in the uncovered
sector ( Khamis, 2013 ).
A third contribution to this literature is the focus on uncondi-
tional distributions. Most of the previous papers only focus on
the conditional distribution of wages. This paper focuses, instead,
on the effects on the unconditional distribution of wages in both
the formal and informal sectors. This adds to a relatively novel lit-
erature focusing on the effects of the minimum wage on uncondi-
tional wage distributions ( Aeberhardt, Givord, & Marbot, 2016;
Bouchot, 2018; Lathapipat & Poggi, 2016 ).
This paper also adds to the literature about the effects of the
minimum wage in Colombia. Maloney and Mendez (2004) argue
the minimum wage is binding and induces spikes in the wage dis-
tribution. Using time series methods, they ﬁnd that the minimum
wage increases wages along the wage distribution. Unlike this
paper, I use cross-sectional variation in minimum wage incidence
and a shock in its real value.
Using dynamic panel data methods, Arango and Pachón (2007)
ﬁnd the minimum wage reduces formal sector family incomes in
the ﬁrst decile. They also ﬁnd positive and signiﬁcant effects forhigher deciles, leading to an increase in inequality. They do not
address the impact on the informal sector, nor do they examine
wages. Arango and Flórez (2017) argue that the minimum wage
increases informality in cities where it is high compared to the
median. They do not carry out any distributional analysis.
Mondragón-Vélez et al. (2010) use time and city variation in the
median to minimum wage ratio to estimate its impact on the prob-
ability of being informal. They ﬁnd that a 10 percent increase in the
minimum wage raises the probability of being informal by 1 per-
cent. This suggests the existence of cross-sectoral effects from
the formal to the informal sector.1. The minimum wage in Colombia and the 1999 shock
In this section, I provide key facts about minimum wage legis-
lation in Colombia and explain the 1999 shock. I show that the
1999 ﬁnancial crisis produced a steep unexpected increase in the
real minimum wage. I use this shock to estimate the effects of a
higher minimum wage incidence on formal wages, informal wages,
and unemployment.
Arango, Herrera, and Posada (2008) summarize the evolution of
the minimum wage in Colombia and the changes in minimum
wage legislation. Current minimum wage regulation in Colombia
is linked to living expenses and changes in labor productivity. In1996, a commission to determine the minimum wage was estab-
lished. It is formed by representatives of the government, ﬁrms,
and unions. Every year, the commission negotiates a minimum
wage increase for the following year. If the commission is unable
to secure an agreement before December 15, the government deci-
des the increase to the minimum wage before the end of the year.
Up to 1998, the government set the minimum wage according
to several parameters: the inﬂation target for the following year,
increases in labor productivity, GDP growth and the evolution of
the consumer price index. From December 1999, the Constitutional
Court also required the minimum wage’s increase to not lie below
the previous year’s inﬂation. Because of this, the minimum wage
has increased its real value since 2000. The minimum wage has
historically been large in Colombia by Latin American standards.
In 1998, the ratio of the minimum wage to the median wage was
0.68 ( Maloney & Mendez, 2004 ).
Fig. 2 shows the evolution of real minimum monthly wages
since 1990. Over this period, the nominal minimum wage ranges
from 88 current USD per month in 1990 to 123 USD per month
at the end of 2012. The real value of the minimum wage jumps
every January as the minimum wage is adjusted. Through the rest
of the year, these real increases are dissipated by inﬂation. The
end-of-year real value of the minimum wage remained stable until
1997 when it started increasing steadily. Note that in 1999 the real
minimum wage has a large increase.
The causes of the 1999 ﬁnancial crisis in Colombia have been
extensively studied ( Gómez-Gonzalez & Kiefer, 2009; Parra &
Salazar, 2000; Villar, Salamanca, & Murcia, 2005
). Colombia expe-
rienced a credit boom in the 900s as a consequence of a ﬁnancial
liberalization. A signiﬁcant expansion of the number of ﬁnancial
institutions and loans was accompanied by reductions in loan
quality. Also, monetary policy contributed to increases in interest
rates. By 1999 a large capital reversion and a decrease in the termsof trade occurred. Sudden increases in non-performing loans forced
the government to intervene and liquidate many of the institu-
tions. GDP decreased by about 4 percent in 1999, but the crisis sub-
sided over the course of two years, and by 2001 it was back at its
1998 level. Unemployment spiked up during the crisis: in 1998q4
the unemployment rate for the 7 largest cities was 15.6 percent,
and it increased to 18 percent by 1999q4, returning to pre-crisis
levels in 2002.
By the last quarter of 1998 inﬂation was expected to be 16 per-
cent for the upcoming year, and the minimum wage was increased
accordingly. However, inﬂation in 1999 turned out to be only 9.25
percent due to the ﬁnancial crisis. The real minimum wage
increased by 6.75 percent by the end of 1999. For the ﬁrst quarter
of 1999, inﬂation was about 5 percent, so the real minimum wage
increased 11 percent between 1998q4 and 1999q1. This increase
was set by the government without agreement from the minimum
wage commission.
Unlike the previous changes in 1997 and 1998, this one was due
to a misalignment between expected and actual inﬂation during
1999. Moreover, this change is different to posterior increases
due to its unexpected nature. After 1999, the minimum wage con-1There are also some studies for other continents. Fan and Alves Pena (2019) do
not ﬁnd evidence of an effect of minimum wages on the wages of non-coveredagricultural workers in the U.S. Khamis (2015) analyze the effect of minimum wages
in Indonesia, ﬁnding limited spillover effects in the informal sector. Dinkelman and
Ranchhod (2012) ,Hohberg and Lay, 2015 ﬁnd wage increases and limited employ-
ment effects of a minimum wage for domestic workers in South Africa.J. Pérez Pérez / World Development 133 (2020) 104999 3

tinued to increase in real terms. These minimum wage hikes were
expected, however, because of a 1999 court ruling that required
minimum wage increases not to be below the inﬂation of the pre-
vious year, instead of ﬁxing them according to expected inﬂation.2
Due to the unexpected and external nature of the ﬁnancial cri-
sis, this shock is arguably more exogenous than other minimum
wage increases analyzed for developing countries ( Fajnzylber,
2001; Khamis, 2013; Lemos, 2009 ). The change was nationwide,
and the posterior inﬂation misalignment was unexpected, so the
shock was unlikely to be driven by local labor market conditions.
However, a major challenge to identiﬁcation of the effects of the
minimum wage shock is the concurrence of the minimum wage
shock and the ﬁnancial crisis. The crisis also caused changes in
unemployment and in the wage distribution, so it is hard to isolate
these effects form the effects of the minimum wage. In the next
section, I describe a differences-in-differences strategy to estimate
the minimum wage effects.
2. Empirical strategy
In this section, I describe the empirical strategy used to estimate
wage effects through the distribution of formal and informal wages
and to estimate employment effects. For the wage effects, I com-
bine an unconditional quantile regression method and a
differences-in-differences speciﬁcation to estimate a quantile
differences-in-differences model. I explain how this methodology
relates to other estimation strategies of the distributional effects
of the minimum wage. I show how I build measures of the mini-
mum wage incidence around the 1999 real minimum wage shock.For the employment effects, I use a standard differences-in-
differences speciﬁcation, which I describe at the end of the section.
2.1. Effects on the wage distribution
2.1.1. Unconditional quantile regressions
My objective is to estimate the effect of the change in the min-
imum wage on the unconditional wage distributions of Fig. 1 . I fol-lowFirpo et al. (2009a) and estimate the effect of a small change in
the minimum wage on the distribution’s quantiles. Let F
WwðÞand
FWjXwjxðÞ be the unconditional and conditional distributions of
wages, respectively. Xis a vector of covariates that includes the
minimum wage. Let QsWðÞ denote the s-th quantile of the distri-
bution of wages FWwðÞ, and QsWjX¼x ðÞ be the conditional quan-
tile given X¼x. The conditional quantile effect (CQE) is the effect
of an inﬁnitesimal change on covariates on the conditional
quantile:
CQEs;xðÞ /C17@QsWjX¼x ðÞ
@xð1Þ
The key assumption to identify this effect is stability of the
quantile function for small changes of X.3Conditional quantile
effects can be estimated by standard quantile regression. However,
these effects would be uninformative about how changes in Ximpact
the overall wage distributions of Fig. 1 instead of the conditional dis-
tributions. To calculate the impact on the overall distribution, the
unconditional quantile effect (UQE) averages these conditional quan-
tile effects over the distribution of covariates, matching each condi-
tional quantile to a quantile on the unconditional distribution. If qsis
thes-th quantile of the unconditional distribution of wages, the UQE
is given by:
UQEsðÞ /C17 ExsXðÞCQE s X ðÞ;X ðÞ ½/C138
xsXðÞ /C17fWjXqsjxðÞ
fWqsðÞ
sxðÞ /C17 s:QsWjX¼x ðÞ ¼ qs fg ;ð2Þ
where fWjXand fWare the conditional and unconditional density
functions of wages. For estimation purposes, Firpo et al. (2009a)
show that the UQE can be rewritten as the average marginal effect

2Corte Constitucional de Colombia (1999) .3This assumption is linked to stability of the conditional distribution function FWjX
for small minimum wage changes ( Fortin, Lemieux, & Firpo, 2011 ). This is a frequent
assumption in papers that study the effects of minimum wage changes on inequality
in the U.S. ( DiNardo et al., 1996 ;Lemos, 1999 ;Autor et al., 2016 ). It may not hold in
the presence of general equilibrium effects, where the function FWjXmay change
when covariates X change. For example, it may not be valid to consider the effects ofeliminating the minimum wage. It may also fail to hold in settings where there isselection in unobservables, such that X includes unobservables that change when theminimum wage changes.4 J. Pérez Pérez / World Development 133 (2020) 104999

[Page 5 of 20]
from a binary response model on the probability of wages exceed-
ing a particular conditional quantile value. I assume a linear form
for this probability model, such that Pr Y >qsjX¼x ½/C138 can be approx-
imated by a linear function.4Under this assumption, Firpo et al.
(2009a) show that this amounts to estimating a linear regression
with the recentered inﬂuence function (RIF) as the dependent
variable:
dRIF W ;cqs/C0/C1
¼1W>cqs/C0/C1
cfWqsðÞþcqs/C01/C0s
cfWqsðÞð3Þ
where cqsandcfWqsðÞare estimates of the quantile and the density at
the quantile, respectively, and 1 ðÞis the indicator function.5,6In the
following section, I explain how I combine this strategy with a
differences-in-differences methodology to estimate the marginal
effect of a minimum wage increase on these quantiles.
2.1.2. A differences-in-differences strategy
To estimate the effect of the minimum wage, I compare wage
distributions across city-industry blocks that have a different inci-
dence of the minimum wage.7Letwicjtbe the wage of individual iin
city cand industry jat time t. My baseline speciﬁcation is a
differences-in-differences regression with the city-industry blocks
as treatment units, and the incidence of the minimum wage as a con-tinuous treatment regressor:
dRIF w icjt;cqs/C0/C1
¼/cjþ/tþhMW cj1t>1998 q4 ðÞ þ dXcjtþeicjt ð4Þ
In this regression, /cjis a city-industry effect and /tis a time
effect, MW cjis a measure of the minimum wage shock incidence,
1(t > 1998q 4) is a dummy variable equal to 1 after the minimum
wage shock, Xcjtare covariates and eicjtis an error term. Although
the minimum wage incidence MW cjis measured at the city-
industry level, the RIF in Eq. (3)is calculated with reference to
the unconditional wage density function. The coefﬁcient hmea-
sures the effect of increasing the minimum wage incidence on this
unconditional wage distribution.8
In absence of cross-sectional variation in the nominal mini-
mum wage, I measure the minimum wage incidence using four
different variables. The ﬁrst variable is the ‘‘fraction affected”
by the minimum wage increase, the proportion of workers earn-
ing between the old and the new real minimum wage. If this
percentage is larger for a particular city-industry pair, this mar-ket should be more affected by the minimum wage increase.
This variable has been used extensively in the minimum wage
literature ( Card, 1992; Khamis, 2013; Lemos, 2009; Stewart,
2002 ). I calculate this incidence for 1998q4, the quarter before
the minimum wage changes:
Fraction Affected cj;98q4¼#mw 98q4/C20wicj;98q4/C20mw 99q1/C0/C1
Ncj;98q4ð5Þ
I calculate this incidence for both formal and informal sectors.
The second incidence variable is a ‘‘fraction at” measure, deﬁnedas:
FractionAt cj;98q4¼#0:9/C2mw 98q4/C20wicj;98q4/C201:1/C2mw 99q1/C0/C1
Ncj;98q4ð6Þ
This fraction counts the number of people who earn a wage
within 10 percent of the minimum wage. The advantage of this
measure, compared to ‘‘fraction affected” is that it may account
for workers who are not classiﬁed as affected due to small mea-
surement errors in wages. The weakness of this measure is that
it involves a choice of the percent deviation from the minimum
wage. Both fraction measures are calculated using real wages. This
is in contrast with Lemos (2009) , who calculates incidence mea-
sures based on nominal wages. The minimum wage shock I con-
sider stems from both an expected increase in the nominal
minimum wage as well as an unexpected increase in the real min-
imum wage. Because of this, I choose to use a real measure.
The third incidence measure is the minimum wage violation
index ( Bhorat, Kanbur, & Stanwix, 2015, 2017 ):
Violation cj;98q4¼Z

mw 99q1wicj;98q4/C20mw 99q1;
0 in other case :(
ð7Þ
This measure calculates the distance of wages to the new min-
imum wage. Compared to ‘‘fraction affected”, this measure
accounts for the fact that if wages were below the minimum wage,
but close to it, the incidence of the minimum wage is lower.
The fourth incidence measure is the minimum to median wage
ratio at the city-industry level. This variable measures how large
the minimum wage is compared to the wages in the market. While
easier to interpret, this measure assumes that the minimum wage
is more binding in low wage markets. This is not necessarily the
case for low-wage informal markets where labor regulations may
not apply.
I assume that the conditional probability of wages exceeding a
given value can be approximated by a linear function. A secondassumption, which is key for identiﬁcation of the minimum wage
effects, is that this conditional probability evolves in parallel across
city-industry blocks.
Because the minimum wage shock occurs at the same time as
the onset of the ﬁnancial crisis, this is a strong assumption. There
may be city-speciﬁc labor market shocks due to the crisis, which
may affect only certain areas of the country. However, the crisis
was induced by an external shock and a capital ﬂow reversal. In
other words, the crisis did not originate from adverse shocks
within the country, which may have been more severe in particular
cities or industries. However, the external shock may have affected
cities or industries differentially. Some of the changes in the distri-
bution may be due to this shock and not to the difference in min-
imum wage incidence. This would happen if the 1999 crisis caused
different effects across industries.
While the unconditional probability of wages exceeding a
value would certainly evolve differently across city-industries
in presence of these crisis effects, the conditional probability4Firpo et al. (2009a) also use this assumption when comparing conditional and
unconditional quantile effects in their empirical application. They ﬁnd that thisestimator performs well and provides estimates close to fully nonparametricestimates. This assumption differs from those used in other application of quantiledifference-in-differences models. Mondragón-Vélez, Peña, and Wills (1995) , assume a
linear speciﬁcation for the conditional quantile function Q
sWðÞ. Other papers that
estimate the effect of minimum wages on inequality, like Lemos (1999) ,Bosch and
Manacorda (2010) and Autor et al. (2016) , also start from a linear model for
conditional quantiles and assume they evolve in parallel across cities or industriesMeyer et al., 1995 .
5I use traditional linear interpolation of closest ranks estimates for cqs.F o r
estimates of fW(qs), I estimate the density fWnon-parametrically with a gaussian
kernel and a Silverman rule bandwidth. Then I plug in the estimates of cqsin the
estimated density.
6Firpo et al. (2009) note that because the density fW(qs) needs to be estimated non-
parametrically, this estimator does not converge at the parametric rate. Therefore, alarge number of observations is needed to estimate f
W(qs). This may hold for quantiles
around the minimum wage, but may not hold for the tails of the distribution.
Additionally, there is some approximation error when assuming that the RIF is linear,which requires a large sample to be negligible. Details are in Firpo et al. (2009b) .
7The choice of city-industry level aggregation is consistent with search theories of
labor demand ( Beaudry, Green, & Sand, 2018 ).
8Since the RIF is measured for the unconditional distribution of wages, the full
sample is used when estimating the density functions in equation (3). This mitigates
small-sample concerns that may arise because the treatment is calculated at the city-industry level.J. Pérez Pérez / World Development 133 (2020) 104999 5

[Page 6 of 20]
may evolve in parallel. This would occur after controlling appro-
priately for the differential effects of the crisis across city-
industry blocks. To address the existence of labor demand shocks
that affect cities differently I control for city-level employment
and Bartik shocks as covariates Xin Eq. (4). Bartik shocks are
intended to capture labor demand shocks that are external to
each city. I also include a 1-year lag of ﬁnancial sector GDP for
each city’s state, to address differential impacts of the ﬁnancial
crisis across cities. To capture city-speciﬁc trends in the distribu-
tions, I allow for a linear city-speciﬁc trend in some speciﬁca-
tions. To address the differential impact of the crisis across
industries, I also control for the national evolution of employ-
ment in each industry.
To conduct inference, I use the wild-bootstrap-t method of
Cameron, Gelbach, and Miller (2008) and cluster by city, therefore
allowing for correlation of the error terms in Eq. (4)across indus-
tries within each city. The bootstrap method is intended to reduce
over rejection, which is frequent in differences-in-differences stud-
ies (Bertrand, Duﬂo, & Mullainathan, 2004 ), and to address the lim-
ited number of clusters. I report parametric standard errors
clustered by city, and p-values and conﬁdence intervals obtained
through the bootstrap procedure.9
2.2. Effects on employment
I estimate effects on employment in both sectors using a
differences-in-differences speciﬁcation on data aggregated at the
city-industry level. I estimate the analog of Eq. (4)for employment:
Ncjt¼/cjþ/tþhMW cj1t>1998 q4 ðÞ þ dXcjtþecjt ð8Þ
Here, Ncjtis employment at the city-industry level. As an alter-
native employment variable, I use hours worked during the last
week at the individual level. As in the previous section, I also try
different speciﬁcations to account for labor demand shocks and
city trends.10
3. Data sources and descriptive Statistics
The data comes from Colombia’s National Household Survey
(ENH) for 1996q2–2000q2. The ENH was a quarterly cross-
sectional survey used to calculate labor market indicators at the
national and city levels. It is representative of the principal
metropolitan areas of the country. The survey collects data on
wages, employment, demographic and labor market variables. I
restrict the estimation sample to occupied workers in the govern-
ment and private sector and exclude the self-employed. I only ana-
lyze data for the 7 cities that are present in all quarters of the
survey and that have a large sample size per city per quarter.11I
classify formal and informal workers into 6 economic activities.12
The sample has 149 city-industry blocks, followed for 17 quarters.I further restrict the estimation sample to workers who work
between 30 and 50 hours per week and are under 65 years old.
The pooled survey sample is representative of 11.67 million
working-age population individuals, of which about 6.04 million
are occupied (51.76 percent). The estimation sample accounts is rep-resentative of 2.38 million workers, or 39.48 percent of occupied
workers.
13
I classify workers who do not receive health insurance provided
by their employer as informal. There are other measures of infor-
mality available, but all of them capture the same dynamics. The
health measure is available for most of the sample, as opposed to
others. Mondragón-Vélez et al. (2010) provide details about how
this measure compares to the alternative ones.14
Table 1 shows sample percentages by minimum wage inci-
dence and formality. The informal sector is large: about 22 per-
cent of workers in the pooled sample are informal according to
the health insurance based measure. Although compliance with
the minimum wage is imperfect in both sectors, there is substan-
tial mass around the minimum wage in the wage distributions.
About 9 percent of workers earn around the minimum wage ineither sector. While most formal workers earn above the mini-
mum wage, most informal workers earn below it.
15Nevertheless,
more than 40 percent of informal workers earn above the mini-
mum wage.
InTable 2 , I describe the distribution of real wages across sec-
tors. I calculate real wages using city-speciﬁc consumer price
indices. The minimum wage is about 74.5 USD of 1998 throughout
the sample. It falls at around the 25th percentile of the distribution
of formal wages, and slightly above the median of the distribution
of informal wages.
InFig. 3 , I show there is substantial heterogeneity in the inci-
dence of the minimum wage across locations and industries before
the shock. In the formal sector, the fractions of workers affected by
the minimum wage shock are larger in the smallest city in the sam-
ple (Pasto). The difference can be as large as 15 percentage points
for some sectors. In the informal sector, the differences across
cities are less evident. Manufacturing and construction are the sec-
tors with the largest incidence across cities and sectors. There are
minimum wage workers present in all industries, as opposed to the
U.S., where they are predominantly in the restaurant industry
(Dube, Lester, & Reich, 2010 ).
4. Results
4.1. Effects on wages4.1.1. Formal sector
Fig. 4 shows the estimated unconditional quantile effects for the
formal wage distribution. I ﬁnd evidence of increases in wages in
the lower tail, implying compression of the distribution. Effects
are found up to the 30th percentile of the distribution, around
the level of the minimum wage. The coefﬁcient peaks around the
25th percentile. For higher percentiles, the effects are not signiﬁ-
cant. Since the minimum wage incidence measures are built by
counting workers near the minimum wage, it is expected that
the effects on higher percentiles of the wage distribution are less
robust.
Table 3 shows these results for selected percentiles of the distri-
bution. These are the increases in log wages at each percentile
when incidence is 1 percentage point larger. The real minimum
9Note that since the p-values are obtained through the bootstrap, standard errors
and p-values may point in different directions.
10I do not control for city or industry level employment in these regressions since
they are endogenous to the city-industry block employment rate.
11These cities are Barranquilla, Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Cali, Manizales, Medellín and
Pasto.
12I use a 1-digit ISIC Rev. 2 classiﬁcation. Although the survey has information at
the 2 digit level, sample sizes within the 2 digit categories are small. From the 9 1-digit categories I exclude Agriculture, Mining and Utilities due to small sample sizes.Overall these excluded industries comprise no more than 2 percent of the pooledsample.13Appendix A includes a detailed breakdown of the sample restrictions.
14Although Colombia’s Department of Statistics (DANE) had some informality-
related questions in the survey, these were only available once a year for this sampleperiod. This has led researchers to use employer-provided health insurance as analternative measure of informality. Mondragón et al. (2010) show that this measure ofinformality and alternative measures, such as whether the employer contributes tothe employee pension or whether the ﬁrm is large, mostly concur and exhibit the
same dynamics. In section A.2. of Appendix A, I provide more detail about this choice
of an informality measure.
15Note that formal workers may still earn below the minimum wage under the
deﬁnition of formality used, based on employer-provided access to health insurance.6 J. Pérez Pérez / World Development 133 (2020) 104999

wage increased by 9.75 percent in the shock. Wages at the 5th
percentile would have gone up by about 2 percent if incidence
had been 10 percentage points higher. These effects grow larger
up to the 25th percentile of the distribution, where wages would
increase about 4 percent with a 10 percentage points higher inci-
dence. The increase in incidence from the market with the least
minimum wage incidence (social services in Bogotá) to the marketwith the most incidence (construction in Manizales) is of about 32
percentage points. My estimates imply that if all cities had this
highest incidence, wages would grow around 12 percent for the
quantiles close and below the minimum wage. It is encouraging
that the sign of these effects is robust to controlling for trends,
Bartik shocks and lagged ﬁnancial GDP, which address the
heterogeneity of crisis-related shocks across city-industries.

----------------------------------------

[Page 8 of 20]
Nevertheless, the magnitude of the point estimates decreases as
additional city-level controls are included. This suggests that these
heterogeneous city-level shocks have some bearing in the relation-
ship between the minimum wage and the wage distribution. InTable B.2 of Appendix B , I report estimates by city. For these, errors
are clustered at the industry level. The effects are noisy given the
limited sample sizes by city and the fact that there are only 7
industries. Nevertheless, the estimated impacts are larger for cities
with a larger ‘‘fraction affected”.
The average incidence of the minimum wage increase, mea-
sured by ‘‘fraction affected”, is 8.5 percent in the estimation sam-
ple. This implies an increase in real wages of 2.9 percent at the
25th percentile. The real minimum wage increased 6.75 percent
between 1998q4 and 1999q4. Therefore, the implied elasticity of
real wages in the formal sector to the real minimum wage at this
percentile is about 0.43.
To better assess the magnitude of these effects, I conduct
two counterfactual exercises. Initially, I assume that after the
minimum wage shock, all the affected workers between theold and the new minimum wage are paid the new minimum.
I calculate the implied conditional quantile effect of Eq. (1)
for each city and industry. Next, I obtain the implied uncondi-
tional quantile effect averaging over the distribution of workers
across city-industry blocks. I scale these effects by the incidence
in each block to obtain an implied coefﬁcient. The results are
shown in Fig. 5 .
The estimated effects are smaller than the implied effects
from a mechanical increase in wages for those affected. The
counterfactual effects are about twice as large. This suggests
wages do not increase for all of the affected workers. However,
in the lower tail of the distribution the estimated effects are
positive. In a framework where only affected workers earn the
new minimum wage, these effects should be zero. Positive
effects may be due to usage of the minimum wage as reference

for wages below it. To see the degree of referencing for these
below-minimum wages, I also calculate counterfactual effects
if all workers below the minimum wage are brought to the
new minimum. Although the estimated effects are positive for
these percentiles, they are signiﬁcantly smaller than the implied
effect of increasing the wage to the minimum for workers
whose wage is smaller.
There are some caveats to these counterfactual exercises. First,
the conditional quantile effects calculated neglect the effect of
other covariates. Higher incidence cities may also be experiencing
worse labor market conditions which allow smaller wage
responses. If this were the case, merely comparing the estimates
to the counterfactual coefﬁcients underestimates the actual inci-
dence of the minimum wage. Second, they assume the absence
of an employment response. For example, if all workers below
the minimum wage were dismissed as a response to the shock,
then the counterfactual estimates would be higher.
Table 3 also shows estimates under alternative speciﬁcations
that include city trends, industry employment and lagged ﬁnancial
sector GDP. The effects are stable in the percentiles near the min-
imum wage and somewhat smaller in the lower tails for somespeciﬁcations. I also estimate the effects using the three other mea-
sures of incidence: the fraction at the minimum wage, the mini-
mum to median wage ratio, and the violation index. Fig. B.1 in
Appendix B shows that the same pattern of effects emerges using
different measures and different intervals around the minimum
wage to measure ‘‘fraction at”.
To check that my estimates are not simply capturing unob-
servables that vary with minimum wage incidence, I provide
two pieces of evidence in Appendix B . I reestimate the effects
on the quarter previous to the minimum wage shock from
1998q3 to 1998q4, using incidence for 1998q4 as the indepen-
dent variable, and excluding all observations after 1998q4.
Fig. B.2 shows an absence of signiﬁcant effects or patterns in
the quantile effects.
I also illustrate the evolution of the formal density of wages
across quarters in Fig. B.3 as a nonparametric way of seeing if
the distribution changes from quarter to quarter. Changes only
appear at the end of every year, where minimum wage shocks
occur, and only around the percentiles around the minimum. Thesefacts suggest the effects I estimated are not due to unobservable
differences across city-industries or time trends in the distribution
of formal wages.
Since there are also minimum wage changes at the end of
1996 and 1997, which seem to be reﬂected in changes in the dis-
tributions in Fig. B.3 , I estimate the wage effects of these mini-
mum wage increases. The results are shown in Fig. B.4 .A
comparison of these effects with the main estimated effects for
1999q1 is illustrative of the different effects of expected and
unexpected minimum wage shocks. This is because the misalign-
ment between expected and observed inﬂation in these years was
smaller, as shown in Fig. 2 , where the largest increase is in
1999q1. The estimated effects are noisier. For the increase in
1997, there are not statistically signiﬁcant effects in either sector,
although the formal sector coefﬁcients are large. For the increasein 1998, there is some slight evidence of effects around the per-
centiles around the minimum wage, but these are much smaller
than the effects in 1999.
Altogether, my results imply a positive and signiﬁcant impact of
the minimum wage shock on the distribution of formal wages at
quantiles below and around the minimum wage. A 10 percentage
points higher minimum wage incidence across cities and industries
would imply wage increases. These are of about 1.5 percent in the
lower tail and of about 3 percent in the percentiles close to the level
of the minimum wage. The results become smaller once I add con-
trols for city-speciﬁc shocks but remain signiﬁcant. I turn to the
effect on the distribution of informal wages in the following section.
4.1.2. Informal sector
I follow the same strategy used in the previous section to esti-
mate effects in the informal wage distribution. Fig. 6 shows the
estimated effects. Panel (a) uses ‘‘fraction affected” as the incidence
variable. The extent of the effects is limited compared to the effects
in the formal sector. There is, however, some evidence of an
increase in median wages. A 10 percentage points larger incidence
of the minimum wage across cities and industries would imply 1
percent higher wages around the 60th percentile according to
the last speciﬁcation. Wages in the lower tail of the distribution
do not seem to react to the minimum wage. This is consistent with
the large non-compliance to the minimum wage in the informal
sector ( Garnero, 2018 ).
Panel (b) shows estimates with ‘‘fraction at”. These are
slightly larger and less noisy than those using ‘‘fraction affected”,
and are statistically signiﬁcant from the 55th to the 70th per-
centile, being larger around the 55th. Table 4
shows the full
results for selected percentiles. In Appendix B Fig. B.5 I overlay
the estimates with the four incidence measures. Estimates using
both the ratio of minimum to median wages and the violationindex yield negative and insigniﬁcant estimates for the middle
of the distribution, but are also large at high percentiles which
may happen because of bias due to measurement error
(Chetverikov, Larsen, & Palmer, 2006 ). Changing the interval
around the minimum wage to measure ‘‘fraction at” changes
the coefﬁcients at low and high percentiles, but not for the per-
centiles around the minimum wage.
The average incidence of the minimum wage in the informal
sector, measured by ‘‘fraction at” in the estimation sample is 10.4
percent. This implies an increase of real wages at the 60th per-
centile –closest to the minimum wage– of about 1.25 percent.
Since the real minimum wage increased by 6.75 percent from
1998q4 to 1999q4, the implied elasticity of real wages to the real
minimum wage is 0.18 in the informal sector.
The estimates for the informal sector are statistically different
from the formal sector ones. In Appendix B Table B.3 I show that
the estimates are different for all percentiles, and for the per-
centiles around the level of the minimum wage in the formal sec-

UQE estimate of the effect of the minimum wage. ‘‘Increase for affected’ shows
implied UQEs in a scenario where for workers between the old and the newminimum wage, the wage is increased to the new minimum wage. ‘‘Increase for allbelow” shows implies UQEs in a scenario where all workers below the newminimum wage are brought up to the new minimum wage.J.

tor. Since the informal sector estimates are noisier, they are not dif-
ferent from the formal sector ones from percentiles 40 to 70. I also
show in Table B.2 that the informal sector estimates are larger for
cities with a larger ‘‘fraction at”, although this relationship is
weaker than for the formal sector results.
I reestimate the effects using ‘‘fraction at” (which yields the lar-
gest estimates) as the incidence measure, for 1998q3–1998q4,
before the minimum wage change. These results are plotted in
Fig. B.6 of Appendix B . The estimates are very noisy, but, as with
the formal sector, insigniﬁcant for percentiles around the mini-
mum wage. It suggests that current estimates only capture the
incidence of the 1999 minimum wage shock. I do not ﬁnd evidence
of wage decreases in the informal sector, which would be sug-
gested by a competitive model.
To summarize, I ﬁnd that higher minimum wage incidence leads
to wage increases in the informal sector around median wages,
around the minimum wage. These effects are smaller and less robust
than those for the formal sector. It is unclear if the effects we observeare due to feedback from the formal into the informal sector or if
they are merely due to indexing in the informal sector. I evaluate
the cross-sectoral effects hypothesis in the next section.
4.1.3. Effects across markets
One reason why we may observe wage increases in the informal
sector in response to the minimum wage shock, in absence of com-
pliance or indexing, is feedback from the formal sector. For exam-
ple, if workers are dismissed from the formal sector in response to
the shock and are employed in the informal sector paid at their
marginal productivity, then we may observe increases in informalwages around the minimum wage. One advantage of the incidence
measures is that they allow me to test this hypothesis. In Fig. 7 I
report estimates of the effect of formal market incidence on the
distribution of informal wages. I do not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effects,
implying the reaction of informal wages to the minimum wage
occurs within the informal market. This test, however, assumes
that cross-sectoral effects occur within each industry. As an alter-
native test in Appendix B, Fig. B.7 , I use the city-level minimum
wage incidence (as opposed to the city-industry level incidence)
in the formal sector as a regressor and also fail to ﬁnd any impact
in the informal sector.
4.2. Effects on employment
In this section I report estimates of the effect of minimum wage
incidence on employment for both sectors. I estimate the
differences-in-differences models described in the empirical strat-
egy section for several measures of employment.
Table 5 shows the estimates. For the formal sector, I do not ﬁnd
any signiﬁcant effects on employment in each of the city-industry
blocks, in either speciﬁcation. This suggests that the wage
increases shown in the previous section were unaccompanied by
adjustments on the amount of labor used. While the 1999 crisis
raised unemployment at the national level, my results suggest that
in the formal sector, city-industries with a larger incidence of the
minimum wage did not experience lower employment as a
response to the shock. This is consistent with the recent literature
on small employment effects of minimum wages ( Belman &
Wolfson, 2014 ). My results can exclusively address the short-
term response to the minimum wage shock and are silent about
long-term effects or effects on employment growth.
For the informal sector, I ﬁnd slight evidence of negative
employment effects. A larger minimum wage incidence is associ-
ated with lower employment in the city-industry.
From these estimates, a 10 percent higher incidence implies 0.5
to 1 percent lower employment in this city-industry block. The
elasticity to incidence ranges from /C00.05 to 0.1. These effects are
of a similar magnitude to those found in other studies for develop-
ing countries. Using the ‘‘fraction at” measure, Lemos (2009) ﬁnds
elasticities of employment to the minimum wage in the Brazilian
informal sector ranging from /C00.05 to 0.14, albeit not signiﬁcant.
These results suggest there is some incidence of the minimum
wage in the informal sector employment. Together with my results
on wages, I argue that this effect is not explained by cross-sectoral
effects from the formal sector. Instead, it could be explained by
lower rigidities in the informal sector that make dismissing work-
ers easier. This is consistent with Mondragón-Vélez et al. (2010) ,
who ﬁnd that minimum wage increases are associated with transi-
tions from high income to low income within the informal sector.

16If employers value their costs at national prices, then using a minimum wage
incidence measure based on real wages constructed with a city-level price index mayresult in biased employment effects. In Appendix Table B.4 I show that results are
similar calculating the minimum wage incidence from real wages constructed withthe national price index.10 J. Pérez Pérez / World Development 133 (2020) 104999

[Page 11 of 20]
These ﬁndings are also consistent with models of imperfect
compliance with the minimum wage. Bhorat, Kanbur, and
Stanwix (2015) show that in a model of partial compliance, there
may be employment losses following a minimum wage increase
and wages may adjust upwards. Basu, Chau, and Kanbur (2010)
and Soundararajan (2019) develop partial compliance models
where employment effects depend on the degree of enforcement.In these models, there are employment losses due to minimum
wage increases below a certain enforcement threshold, where
the market is competitive, and limited employment losses above
this threshold, where the model becomes an efﬁciency wage
model. An alternative explanation for the employment results
found here would be the existence of monopsonies in the formal
sector and their absence in the informal sector.
5. Concluding remarks
In this paper, I have estimated the effect of an unexpected min-
imum wage shock on the informal and formal wage distributions
in Colombia. By comparing markets with a high and a low inci-
dence of the minimum wage, I ﬁnd that only wages close to theminimum wage rise. The increase for a 10 percentage points higher
incidence is about 3 percent in the formal sector, and 1.3 percent in
the informal sector. I observe slight evidence of negative employ-
ment effects in the informal sector, which cannot be explained
by cross-sectoral effects from the formal sector.
My results concur with previous literature for developing coun-
tries. They are different from the previous ﬁndings about the effect
of the minimum wage in Colombia. The difference in ﬁndings is in
line with the literature on the compelling research designs in min-
imum wage research. My design exploits cross-sectional variation
as well as time variation and controls for time-varying heterogene-
ity, which makes my estimates more plausible than traditional
difference-in-differences analyses. The results suggest minimum
wages affect the informal sector per se, and not through cross-
sectoral effects from the formal sector, as the competitive model
suggests.
There are several limitations of this study. First, it may be difﬁ-
cult to extrapolate these results to the effects of minimum wagesTable 4

on the formal and informal sector in other developing countries.
Although useful for identiﬁcation, the change in the real minimum
wage studied here is particular to this institutional setting and to
the inﬂation shock. The results may not hold for larger minimum
wage increases, for minimum wage increases coming from other
policy changes, or for different contexts. Another limitation is the
limited exploration of city-level heterogeneity in the results, due
to the small sample sizes by city. The results suggest that hetero-
geneous city-level labor market shocks play a role in determining
the response of wages to the minimum wage in either sector, but
this could be examined further in other settings with more detailed
data. Another possible avenue for further research is to examinethe role of other explanations, like wage indexing, to explain the
existence of direct effects and the absence of indirect effects in
the informal sector.

Appendix A
DataData sources
The data on wages, demographic and labor market character-
istics comes from Colombia’s National Household Survey (ENH)
for the years 1996–2000. The ENH was a quarterly rotating
cross-sectional survey used to calculate labor market indicators
at a National and City Level. It is representative of the main
metropolitan areas in the country. From 2001, there was a change
in the methodology of the survey and it was replaced by the Con-
tinuous Household Survey (ECH), with an extended sample and
monthly data collection. As noted by Arango, García, and Posada
(2008) , the methodological differences between surveys make
time comparisons difﬁcult, so I restrict my analysis to ENH data.
I only analyze data for the 7 cities that are present in all quarters
of the survey and that have a large sample size per city per quar-
ter: Barranquilla, Bogotá, Bucaramanga, Cali, Manizales, Medellín
and Pasto. The survey collects labor market information on indi-
viduals, including occupation status, salaries and weekly hours
of work, along with demographic and labor market
characteristics.
The monthly minimum wage information comes from the
Colombian Central Bank.
17Employees who earn the minimum wage
are also entitled to a transportation subsidy, which varies from
around 8 to 10 percent of the monthly minimum wage. I obtained
transportation subsidy information from the Colombian Institute of
Tax Law. All minimum wage workers receive the transportation sub-
sidy, although it is not considered part of the wage for social security
purposes. All the minimum wage ﬁgures include this transportation
subsidy as part of the minimum wage.
To obtain real wages, I use city-level consumer price indexes
with 1998 as the base year from the Colombian National Depart-
ment of Statistics (DANE).18This dataset includes consumer priceTable 5

Annual ﬁnancial sector GDP at the state level comes from DANE.
Each state corresponds to a single city in the sample. I keep GDP
coming from the Financial Intermediation, Real Estate and Finan-
cial Firms sectors.
Sample selection and classiﬁcation of workers as formal or informal
For the results on wages, I only consider occupied workers in
the private and government sectors and exclude family-member
non-remunerated workers, self-employed workers, and business
owners. I also exclude domestic workers. A large share of these
workers earns wages below the minimum wage, but their wages
may be nevertheless indexed to it. I consider only workers who
report wages for the last month, who are between 12 and 65 years
of age, and who work between 30 and 50 h a week. This is
intended to mitigate the measurement error in hours, and to
ensure that my results are comparable to those of Arango and
Pachón (2007) to some degree. Following Solon, Haider, and
Wooldridge (2015) , all my descriptive statistics use survey
weights, but the main results of the paper instead use bootstrap-
ping to account for the heteroscedasticity due to the survey
design.
Formal workers are deﬁned as workers who are covered by
health insurance by their ﬁrm, as required by Colombian law.
Speciﬁcally, in the time period I analyze, the law required the
employer to enroll its permanent workers in health insurance,
and share its costs with the employee. For transitory workers, a
percentage of the worker’s salary is intended to be used to pay
for health insurance, and the employee has to provide proof of
health insurance enrollment to the employer. For the second and
fourth quarters of 1996, the survey did not ask speciﬁcally for
health insurance coverage sponsored by the employer, but rather
for general enrollment in health insurance. I use workers who
reported to be covered by health insurance for those periods. For
the rest of the sample, these variables are highly correlated. For
1996q3, only about 6 percent of workers in the estimation sample
who were enrolled in health insurance did not have employer-
provided health insurance, and these accounted for about 4.8 per-
cent of total workers. If this percentage is similar for 1996q2 and
1996q4, then at most 4.8 percent of workers in the sample may
be misclassiﬁed as formal in these quarters.
My choice of an informality measure is based on availability and
performance. The health measure is available for all but two quar-
ters of the sample, as mentioned above. Mondragón-Vélez et al.
(2010) show that this measure of informality and alternative mea-
sures, such as whether the employer contributes to the employee
pension or whether the ﬁrm is large, mostly concur and exhibit
the same dynamics. The ﬁrm size deﬁnition, as Mondragón-Vélez
et al. (2010) notes, is not related to labor market regulations. The
pension-based deﬁnition is highly correlated with the health-
based deﬁnition: according to Mondragón-Vélez et al. (2010) , each
year only 1 percent of workers classiﬁed as informal under thehealth-based criterion would be labeled formal under the pension
criterion. These alternative measures are not available for the
entire sample I consider.
I classify formal and informal workers into economic activities
using a 1-digit ISIC Rev. 2 classiﬁcation. Although the survey has
information at the 2 digit level, sample sizes within the 2 digit cat-
egories are small. From the 9 1-digit categories, I exclude Agricul-
ture, Mining and Utilities due to small sample sizes. Overall these
excluded industries comprise no more than 2 percent of the pooled
sample.
Overall, the pooled sample is representative of 11.6 million
working-age individuals, of which 6.04 million are occupied
(51.76 percent). Of these occupied workers, 63.2 percent are not
government workers or self-employed. Excluding workers older
than 65 years reduces the sample to 62.8 percent of occupiedworkers. Those who work between 30 and 50 h a week are 42.8
percent of the occupied. Those who are in the six cities and seven
industries of interest are 39.48 percent of the occupied.
Variable construction
The nominal wage is self-reported by individuals. Although
most wages are reported at the monthly level, some of them are
reported at higher or lower frequencies: for those cases, I calculate
monthly equivalents. I obtain real wages deﬂating this variable
using city-level price indices, and I deﬂate the minimum wage
using the countrywide consumer price index. I focus on log real
monthly wages throughout all the analysis.
To account for local labor demand shocks, I use city-level Bartik
shock variables, which are common in the local labor markets lit-
erature ( Bartik, 1991 ). These are intended to capture local labor
demand shocks unrelated to local labor supply. The Bartik price
and Bartik quantity shocks are deﬁned as
